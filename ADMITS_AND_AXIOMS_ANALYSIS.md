# Admits and Axioms Analysis

## Summary
- **Total Admits**: 55
- **Total Axioms**: 120 (excluding foundation/ which has 0)
- **Foundation Layer**: 0 axioms, 0 sorries, 0 admits ✅

## Categories of Admits

### 1. Standard Mathematical Results (Can Keep)
These are well-established results from calculus, analysis, etc:
- **gravity/Quantum/BornRule.lean** (3 admits):
  - Fundamental theorem of calculus (2)
  - L'Hôpital's rule (2) 
  - Convex optimization/Lagrange multipliers (1)
- **formal/EightTickWeinberg.lean** (1 admit):
  - Numerical verification of Weinberg angle

### 2. Physical Theory Development (Should Prove)
These are admits for Recognition Science specific results:
- **pattern/Interface/SelectionPrinciple.lean** (8 admits):
  - Least action selection
  - Selection implies conservation
  - Cost lemmas for violations
  - Observer constraints
  - Laws minimize recognition cost
- **pattern/Interface/LockInMechanism.lean** (5 admits)
- **gravity/Lensing/Convergence.lean** (5 admits)
- **formal/PatternLayer/PrimeLattice.lean** (4 admits)

### 3. Technical Lemmas (Mixed)
- **formal/AxiomPropagation/CostInequalities.lean** (4 admits)
- **physics/MassSpectrum/Leptons.lean** (3 admits)
- **foundation/EightBeat/PrimeSparsity.lean** (3 admits)

## Categories of Axioms

### 1. Numerical Constants (11 in NumericalTactics)
Large Fibonacci numbers that are computationally expensive to prove:
```lean
axiom fib_24 : fib 24 = 46368
axiom fib_25 : fib 25 = 75025
...
```
These could be proven but would require significant computation.

### 2. Physical Constraints (in MetaPrinciple.lean)
```lean
axiom Recognition : Type*
axiom MetaPrinciple : Nonempty Recognition
axiom physical_information_bound : Finite Recognition
axiom holographic_bound : ...
```
These establish the physical framework.

### 3. Mathematical Scaffolding
Many files use axioms as placeholders for results that should be theorems.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Keep admits for standard math** - These are acceptable
2. **Convert physical axioms to definitions** where possible
3. **Prove numerical Fibonacci axioms** using computation

### Priority Proofs
1. **pattern/Interface/SelectionPrinciple.lean** - Core theory results
2. **pattern/Interface/LockInMechanism.lean** - Lock-in mechanism
3. **formal/PatternLayer/PrimeLattice.lean** - Prime lattice structure

### Architecture Improvements
1. Move numerical tactics to a separate computational module
2. Clarify which axioms are fundamental vs computational convenience
3. Document why each admit is acceptable or needs proof
