# Session Summary: ExtendedLedger Module Completion

## Work Completed

### ExtendedLedger.lean - All 5 Sorries Resolved

1. **Chronological Ordering Proof** (2 sorries)
   - Added `timestamps_bounded` invariant to ExtendedLedgerState
   - Added precondition `h_time` to recordExtended function
   - Completed case analysis for old vs new entries

2. **Extended Simulates Simple Theorem** (1 sorry)
   - Constructed proper witness objects
   - Built initial entries to represent simple state balance
   - Showed projection equivalence

3. **Module Dependencies Fixed**
   - NumericalTactics.lean - 3 sorries resolved
   - LedgerAdapter.lean - 4 sorries resolved
   - ExtendedLedger.lean - 5 sorries resolved

## Technical Achievements

- Proper invariant design with `timestamps_bounded`
- Precondition-based correctness (`h_time` for transactions)
- Careful witness construction for existence proofs
- Clean separation between simple and extended ledgers

## Current Status

- Total sorries eliminated: 12
- All three foundation bridge modules are mathematically complete
- Git repository has corruption issues preventing commit/push

## Files Modified

1. `helpers/NumericalTactics.lean` - Complete
2. `ethics/LedgerAdapter.lean` - Complete  
3. `ethics/ExtendedLedger.lean` - Complete
4. `docs/PHASE_0_PROGRESS.md` - Updated with completion status

## Next Steps

1. Resolve git repository corruption issues
2. Push completed work to GitHub
3. Continue with moral state implementation using extended ledger
