# Gravity Reproduction Scripts

This directory contains Python scripts for reproducing gravity analyses.

## Data Location

The SPARC galaxy rotation data files (`Rotmod_LTG/*.dat`) are located in:
```
../data/Rotmod_LTG/
```

## Scripts

The scripts in this directory analyze the SPARC galaxy rotation curves using the Recognition Science bandwidth triage model.

### Key Scripts:
- Analysis scripts for galaxy rotation curves
- Model fitting and comparison tools
- Visualization utilities

## Usage

Most scripts expect the data files to be in `../data/Rotmod_LTG/`. If running from a different location, update the data paths accordingly.
