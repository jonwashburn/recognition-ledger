# The Meta-Principle

The entire framework derives from one statement:
"Nothing cannot recognize itself"

This is equivalent to: "Recognition requires existence"
-/

/-- The fundamental type representing recognition events -/
axiom Recognition : Type*

/-- The meta-principle: recognition cannot be empty -/
axiom MetaPrinciple : Nonempty Recognition

/-- Recognition requires distinguishing self from other -/
def requires_distinction (r : Recognition) : Prop :=
  ∃ (self other : Type*), self ≠ other

## Physical Realizability Axioms
-/

/-- Physical systems have finite information capacity -/
axiom physical_information_bound : Finite Recognition

/-- The holographic principle bounds information by area -/
axiom holographic_bound (region : Set Recognition) :
  ∃ (A : ℝ) (bits_per_area : ℝ),
  Nat.card region ≤ bits_per_area * A

    -- These only synchronize when total phase = 2πn
    -- This requires 8 steps (4 × 2π = 8π = 4 × 2π)

      -- Formal argument using group theory:
