-- φ > 1
theorem golden_ratio_gt_one : φ > 1 := by
  -- φ = (1 + √5)/2 and √5 > 2, so φ > (1 + 2)/2 = 1.5 > 1
  sorry -- Numerical computation

-- The eight-beat property
theorem eight_beat : 2 * 4 = 8 := by

-- Cost minimization leads to φ
theorem cost_minimization_golden_ratio (DR : DiscreteRecognition) (PC : PositiveCost) (SS : SelfSimilarity PC DR) :
  SS.lambda = φ ∨ SS.lambda = -1/φ := by
  -- From self-similarity: λ² = λ + 1
  -- The two solutions are φ and -1/φ
  -- Since λ > 1, we must have λ = φ
  sorry -- This requires the full self-similarity analysis

-- Recognition operator fixed points
theorem recognition_fixed_points :
  ∃ J : ℝ → ℝ, (∀ x, J (J x) = x) ∧
  (∃! vacuum : ℝ, J vacuum = vacuum) ∧
  (∃! phi_state : ℝ, phi_state ≠ vacuum ∧ J phi_state = phi_state) := by
  -- The recognition operator has exactly two fixed points
  sorry -- This is one of our remaining sorries
