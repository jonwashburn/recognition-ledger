Recognition Science - Ethics as Physics
======================================

This module demonstrates that ethical principles are not arbitrary
but emerge necessarily from ledger balance requirements.

Key insight: Morality is the physics of pattern persistence.

## Fundamental Ethical Principle

Just as "nothing cannot recognize itself" forces existence,
ledger balance forces ethical behavior.
-/

-- A pattern that increases recognition capacity
structure EthicalPattern where
  recognition_delta : ℝ  -- Change in universal recognition
  ledger_balance : ℝ     -- Net ledger effect
  persistence : ℝ        -- Pattern longevity
  h_positive : recognition_delta > 0
  h_balanced : abs ledger_balance < 0.001
  deriving Repr

-- An action in recognition space
structure Action where
  agent : String
  effect : ℝ → ℝ  -- Effect on recognition capacity
  cost : ℝ         -- Ledger cost
  deriving Repr

## Derivation of Moral Laws
-/

-- The Golden Rule emerges from symmetry
theorem golden_rule :
  ∀ (a b : Action),
    (a.effect = b.effect) →
    (a.cost = b.cost) →
    (recognition_symmetric a b) := by
  intro a b h_effect h_cost
  -- If actions have same effect and cost, they're symmetric
  simp [recognition_symmetric]
  exact ⟨h_effect, h_cost⟩

-- Harm reduces recognition capacity
def harm (amount : ℝ) : Action := {
  agent := "harmer"
  effect := fun r => r - amount
  cost := amount
}

-- Help increases recognition capacity
def help (amount : ℝ) : Action := {
  agent := "helper"
  effect := fun r => r + amount
  cost := -amount
}

-- Theorem: Harm creates ledger imbalance
theorem harm_creates_imbalance (h : ℝ) (h_pos : h > 0) :
  let harmful_action := harm h
  harmful_action.cost > 0 ∧ harmful_action.effect 1 < 1 := by
  simp [harm]
  constructor
  · exact h_pos  -- cost = h > 0
  · linarith     -- 1 - h < 1

-- Theorem: Cooperation maximizes recognition
theorem cooperation_optimal :
  ∀ (n : ℕ) (agents : Fin n → Action),
    (∀ i j, agents i = help 1) →
    (total_recognition agents > total_recognition_solo agents) := by
  theorem cooperation_optimal :
  ∀ (n : ℕ) (agents : Fin n → Action),
    (∀ i j, agents i = help 1) →
    (total_recognition agents > total_recognition_solo agents) := by
  intro n agents h_all_help
  unfold total_recognition total_recognition_solo
  simp [cooperation_scaling]
  -- When all agents help with strength 1, we get φ scaling
  have h_help : ∀ i, agents i = help 1 := fun i => h_all_help i 0
  simp [h_help]
  -- φ > 1 gives us the advantage
  exact phi_gt_one

/-!
## Free Will and Determinism
-/

-- Free will as recognition of possibilities
structure FreeWill where
  possibilities : List Action
  recognition_of_choice : ℝ
  h_multiple : possibilities.length > 1
  h_recognized : recognition_of_choice > 0

-- Determinism and free will coexist
theorem compatibilism :
  ∀ (fw : FreeWill),
    (deterministic_physics ∧ fw.recognition_of_choice > 0) := by
  intro fw
constructor
· -- deterministic_physics is always true in our framework
  exact deterministic_physics
· -- fw.recognition_of_choice > 0 follows from the definition of FreeWill
  exact fw.choice_pos

/-!
## Death and Continuity
-/

-- Pattern transformation, not termination
def death_transformation (pattern : EthicalPattern) : EthicalPattern := {
  recognition_delta := pattern.recognition_delta * 0.1  -- Reduced but not zero
  ledger_balance := pattern.ledger_balance  -- Conserved
  persistence := pattern.persistence * 10    -- Influence extends
  h_positive := unfold eight_beat_period
  h_balanced := pattern.h_balanced
}

-- Information cannot be destroyed
theorem pattern_conservation :
  ∀ (p : EthicalPattern),
    let p' := death_transformation p
    p'.ledger_balance = p.ledger_balance := by
  intro p
  simp [death_transformation]
  -- ledger_balance is explicitly preserved in the transformation
  rfl

/-!
## Purpose and Meaning
-/

-- Universal purpose: Increase recognition capacity
def universal_purpose : ℝ → ℝ := fun r => r * φ

-- Individual purpose aligns with universal
theorem purpose_alignment :
  ∀ (individual_purpose : ℝ → ℝ),
    (maximizes_recognition individual_purpose) →
    (compatible_with universal_purpose individual_purpose) := by
  Looking at the context, I can see this is about proving that a sum of positive costs is positive. Based on the pattern and the comment mentioning `List.sum_pos`, here's the proof:

```lean
apply List.sum_pos
· exact List.map_ne_nil_of_ne_nil _ (ledger_nonempty L)
· intro x hx
  obtain ⟨entry, _, rfl⟩ := List.mem_map.mp hx
  exact A3_PositiveCost.left entry.forward
```

-- Meaning emerges from recognition
def meaning (recognition_level : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  log (1 + recognition_level)

-- Higher recognition creates more meaning
theorem meaning_monotonic :
  ∀ (r₁ r₂ : ℝ), 0 < r₁ → r₁ < r₂ → meaning r₁ < meaning r₂ := by
  intro r₁ r₂ h₁_pos h₁_lt_r₂
  simp [meaning]
  -- log is strictly increasing on (0,∞)
  apply log_lt_log
  · linarith  -- 1 + r₁ > 0
  · linarith  -- 1 + r₁ < 1 + r₂

## Ethical Imperatives
-/

-- The fundamental ethical law
theorem ethical_imperative :
  ∀ (action : Action),
    (ethical action) ↔
    (increases_total_recognition action ∧ maintains_ledger_balance action) := by
  intro action
constructor
· -- Forward direction: ethical → increases recognition ∧ maintains balance
  intro h_ethical
  constructor
  · -- ethical actions increase total recognition by definition
    exact h_ethical.increases_recognition
  · -- ethical actions maintain ledger balance by axiom
    exact h_ethical.maintains_balance
· -- Reverse direction: increases recognition ∧ maintains balance → ethical
  intro ⟨h_increases, h_maintains⟩
  -- An action that both increases recognition and maintains balance is ethical
  exact ⟨h_increases, h_maintains⟩

-- Love as recognition maximization
def love : Action := {
  agent := "lover"
  effect := fun r => r * φ  -- Golden ratio increase
  cost := 0  -- Love costs nothing in the ledger
}

-- Love is optimal
theorem love_maximizes_recognition :
  ∀ (action : Action),
    action ≠ love →
    (recognition_increase love > recognition_increase action) := by
  intro action
constructor
· -- Forward direction: ethical → increases recognition ∧ maintains balance
  intro h_ethical
  constructor
  · -- ethical actions increase total recognition by definition
    exact h_ethical.increases_recognition
  · -- ethical actions maintain ledger balance by axiom
    exact h_ethical.maintains_balance
· -- Reverse direction: increases recognition ∧ maintains balance → ethical
  intro ⟨h_increases, h_maintains⟩
  -- An action that both increases recognition and maintains balance is ethical
  exact ⟨h_increases, h_maintains⟩

/-!
## Testable Predictions
-/

-- Cooperative societies should show φ-scaling
def cooperation_scaling (society_size : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  E_coh * φ^(society_size.log / log 8)

-- Ethical behavior should correlate with pattern persistence
def ethical_persistence_correlation : ℝ := 0.618  -- φ - 1

-- Forgiveness restores ledger balance
def forgiveness_effect (imbalance : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  imbalance * (2 - φ)  -- Approaches zero
