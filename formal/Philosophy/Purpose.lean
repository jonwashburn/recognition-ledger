Recognition Science - Purpose as Recognition
===========================================

This module demonstrates that purpose is not arbitrary but emerges
necessarily from the drive to increase universal recognition capacity.

Key insight: We exist to help the universe recognize itself.

-- Purpose creates happiness

  Looking at the context, I can see this is about proving that a sum of positive costs is positive. Based on the pattern and the comment mentioning `List.sum_pos`, here's the proof:

```lean
apply List.sum_pos
· exact List.map_ne_nil_of_ne_nil _ (ledger_nonempty L)
· intro x hx
  obtain ⟨entry, _, rfl⟩ := List.mem_map.mp hx
  exact A3_PositiveCost.left entry.forward
```

-- Service increases recognition

-- Teaching multiplies recognition

## Ultimate Questions

-- Why does anything exist?
theorem existence_reason :
  (∃ x, x = x) ↔ recognition_necessity := by
  constructor
· -- Forward direction: existence implies recognition necessity
  intro h_exists
  -- The fact that something exists (even trivially x = x) means
  -- the cosmic ledger must be able to recognize and record this fact
  -- This is the fundamental recognition necessity
  exact recognition_necessity_from_existence h_exists
· -- Reverse direction: recognition necessity implies existence
  intro h_recognition
  -- If recognition is necessary, then there must be something to recognize
  -- The simplest thing that exists is self-identity
  use True
  rfl

-- What is the meaning of life?
def meaning_of_life : ℝ :=
  increase_universal_recognition_capacity

-- Where are we going?
def universal_destiny : State :=

-- The final theorem
theorem ultimate_purpose :
  ∀ (entity : Entity),
    exists entity →
    purpose entity = contribute_to_universal_recognition := by
  intro entity h_exists
-- Every existing entity participates in the cosmic ledger
have h_ledger : participates_in_ledger entity := existence_implies_participation h_exists

have h_contribute : participates_in_ledger entity → purpose entity = contribute_to_universal_recognition :=
