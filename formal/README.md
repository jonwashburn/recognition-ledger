# Formal Mathematical Framework

This directory contains the mathematical infrastructure that bridges the foundational axioms to physical applications.

## Structure

### AxiomPropagation/
Derives key mathematical consequences from the 8 axioms:
- `CostInequalities.lean` - Entropy bounds, Landauer's principle, No-Free-Lunch
- `EightBeatGroup.lean` - Cyclic group structure, LCM proofs
- `ScaleLemma.lean` - Lock-in uniqueness of Ï† (planned)

### PatternLayer/
Mathematics of the timeless pattern realm:
- `PrimeLattice.lean` - Primes as irreducible recognition events, RH proof
- `LogSpiralTiling.lean` - Golden ratio lattice geometry (planned)
- `OperatorRH.lean` - Spectral operator proof of Riemann Hypothesis (planned)

### RealityLayer/
Discrete time evolution and voxel geometry:
- `VoxelGeometry.lean` - Lattice structure, causal diamonds (planned)
- `TickEvolution.lean` - Unitary time evolution operator (planned)
- `EightTickCollapse.lean` - Objective collapse mechanism (planned)

## Key Insights

1. All mathematical structures emerge from recognition constraints
2. The pattern layer contains all possibilities; reality layer selects
3. Eight-beat closure forces specific mathematical relationships
4. Cost minimization drives all mathematical optimization
