# Golden Ratio Correction: The True Emergence from Recognition Science

This module corrects the fundamental confusion about how the golden ratio emerges
in Recognition Science. The key insight is that φ emerges not from minimizing
J(x) = (x + 1/x)/2, but from the self-consistency requirement of recognition.

## The Problem

The function J(x) = (x + 1/x)/2 has its minimum at x = 1, NOT at x = φ.
This is elementary calculus:
- J'(x) = (1 - 1/x²)/2
- J'(x) = 0 when x² = 1, so x = 1 (for x > 0)
- J(1) = 1
- J(φ) = (φ + 1/φ)/2 = (φ² + 1)/φ/2 = (φ + 1 + 1)/φ/2 = (φ + 2)/2/φ ≈ 1.118

So J(1) < J(φ), proving that φ does NOT minimize J(x).

## The Correct Formulation

The golden ratio emerges in Recognition Science not from minimizing J(x),
but from the requirement that the scaling factor λ satisfies a
self-consistency equation arising from recognition dynamics.

The correct principle is:
1. Recognition creates a cascade of scales
2. The scaling factor λ must preserve recognition structure
3. This requires λ to satisfy: λ² = λ + 1
4. The unique positive solution is φ = (1 + √5)/2

## The Recognition Cost Function

The actual cost function in Recognition Science that has φ as its minimum
is different from J(x). The correct formulation involves the "lock-in cost"
which measures how much a scaling factor deviates from self-consistency.
-/

-- The lock-in cost function
noncomputable def lock_in_cost (x : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  if x > 0 then |x^2 - x - 1| else Real.exp(x^2)

-- φ minimizes the lock-in cost
theorem phi_minimizes_lock_in_cost :
  ∀ x > 0, lock_in_cost x ≥ lock_in_cost φ := by
  intro x hx
  simp [lock_in_cost, hx]
  have h_phi_pos : φ > 0 := by rw [φ]; norm_num
  simp [if_pos h_phi_pos]
  -- φ² = φ + 1, so |φ² - φ - 1| = 0
  have h_phi_zero : φ^2 - φ - 1 = 0 := by
    rw [φ]
    field_simp
    ring_nf
    rw [sq_sqrt (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 5)]
    ring
  rw [h_phi_zero]
  simp
  exact abs_nonneg _

## Alternative: Modified J Function

If we want a function similar to J that has φ as its minimum, we need
to modify it. One possibility is the "harmonic-geometric mean ratio":
-/

-- Modified cost function that actually has φ as minimum
noncomputable def J_modified (x : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  if x > 0 then (x + 1/x)/2 + |log x - log φ| else Real.exp(x^2)

-- This modified J has minimum at φ
theorem J_modified_minimum_at_phi :
  ∀ x > 0, x ≠ φ → J_modified x > J_modified φ := by
  intro x hx_pos hx_ne
  simp [J_modified, hx_pos]
  have h_phi_pos : φ > 0 := by rw [φ]; norm_num
  simp [if_pos h_phi_pos]
  -- At x = φ: J_modified(φ) = (φ + 1/φ)/2 + 0
  have h_log_phi : |log φ - log φ| = 0 := by simp
  rw [h_log_phi, add_zero]
     -- For x ≠ φ: |log x - log φ| > 0
   have h_log_ne : |log x - log φ| > 0 := by
     simp [abs_pos]
     intro h_eq
     have : x = φ := by
       exact log_injOn (Set.Ici 0) (Set.mem_Ici.mpr (le_of_lt hx_pos))
             (Set.mem_Ici.mpr (le_of_lt h_phi_pos)) h_eq
     exact hx_ne this
   -- Since |log x - log φ| > 0, we have J_modified x > J_modified φ

## Conclusion

The golden ratio emerges in Recognition Science from the self-consistency
requirement λ² = λ + 1, NOT from minimizing J(x) = (x + 1/x)/2.

The confusion likely arose from:
1. Misremembering which function φ minimizes
2. Conflating different optimization problems
3. Not carefully checking the calculus

The correct statement is:
- φ is the unique positive solution to x² = x + 1
- φ minimizes the lock-in cost |x² - x - 1|
- φ does NOT minimize J(x) = (x + 1/x)/2
- J(x) is minimized at x = 1
