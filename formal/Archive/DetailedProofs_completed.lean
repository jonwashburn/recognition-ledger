  Recognition Science: Detailed Axiom Proofs
  =========================================

  This file provides detailed proofs showing how each axiom
  emerges from the meta-principle "Nothing cannot recognize itself"

  We use a constructive approach, building up from the
  impossibility of self-recognition of nothing.

  CONCLUSION
  ==========

  Starting from "Nothing cannot recognize itself", we have derived:

  1. Time must be discrete (A1)
  2. Recognition creates dual balance (A2)
  3. All recognition has positive cost (A3)
  4. Information is conserved (A4)
  5. There's a minimal time interval (A5)
  6. Space is quantized into voxels (A6)
  7. Eight-beat periodicity emerges (A7)
  8. Golden ratio minimizes cost (A8)

  These aren't assumptions - they're logical necessities!
