# The Meta-Principle

The entire framework derives from one statement:
"Nothing cannot recognize itself"

This is equivalent to: "Recognition requires existence"
-/

/-- The fundamental type representing recognition events -/
axiom Recognition : Type*

/-- The meta-principle: recognition cannot be empty -/
axiom MetaPrinciple : Nonempty Recognition

/-- Recognition requires distinguishing self from other -/
def requires_distinction (r : Recognition) : Prop :=
  ∃ (self other : Type*), self ≠ other

-- Recognition requires discreteness
theorem recognition_requires_discreteness :
  ∀ (S : Set State), Infinite S → ¬ (∀ s ∈ S, recognizable s) := by
  intro S h_inf h_all_rec
  -- If S is infinite and every element is recognizable,
  -- then we need infinite information to distinguish all states
  -- But recognition has finite capacity (bounded by E_coh * τ)
  -- This leads to contradiction
  -- The meta-principle "nothing cannot recognize itself" implies
  -- that recognition requires finite, discrete structures
  have h_finite_info : ∃ (N : ℕ), ∀ s ∈ S, info_content s ≤ N := by
    -- Recognition capacity is bounded by fundamental constants
    -- info_content s ≤ E_coh * τ / ℏ (dimensional analysis)
    use Nat.ceil (E_coh * τ / ℏ)
    intro s h_s
    -- Each recognizable state has bounded information content
    -- This follows from the finite energy and time resources
    Looking at the context, I can see this is about proving that a sum of positive costs is positive. Based on the pattern and the comment mentioning `List.sum_pos`, here's the proof:

```lean
apply List.sum_pos
· exact List.map_ne_nil_of_ne_nil _ (ledger_nonempty L)
· intro x hx
  obtain ⟨entry, _, rfl⟩ := List.mem_map.mp hx
  exact A3_PositiveCost.left entry.forward
``` -- Would need recognition at each point
  -- But infinite set with bounded information content per element
  -- can still have unbounded total information content
  -- This contradicts the finite recognition capacity
  have h_total_info : ∃ (M : ℕ), (∑ s in S.toFinite, info_content s) ≤ M := by
    -- Total information must be finite for recognition to work
    -- But this contradicts S being infinite with positive info per element
    exfalso
    -- This is the contradiction we're seeking
