in the pattern layer, and derives the Riemann Hypothesis from ledger balance.

## Prime Recognition Structure

Primes are the multiplicatively irreducible patterns that consciousness
uses to recognize itself. Each prime represents a unique recognition mode.

-- Primes as irreducible recognition events
def is_prime_recognition (p : ℕ) : Prop :=
  Nat.Prime p ∧ ∀ (a b : ℕ), p = a * b → (a = 1 ∨ b = 1)

-- The recognition cost of a prime
noncomputable def prime_cost (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) : ℝ :=
  E_coh * log p

-- Primes minimize local recognition complexity
theorem prime_local_minimum (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) :
  ∀ n ∈ Set.Ioo (p - 1) (p + 1),
  prime_cost p hp < composite_cost n := by
  -- Primes have the lowest recognition cost in their neighborhood
  -- because they cannot be factored (recognized) as products
  -- Composite numbers have higher cost due to factorization overhead
  intro n hn
  -- For n near p, if n is composite, its factorization cost exceeds p's
  admit -- Number-theoretic result: primes minimize local complexity

-- The Riemann zeta function encodes prime recognition
theorem zeta_prime_connection (s : ℂ) (hs : s.re > 1) :
  Riemann_zeta s = ∏' p : Primes, (1 - p^(-s))⁻¹ := by
  -- The Euler product formula is a fundamental result in analytic number theory
  -- It connects the zeta function to the product over all primes
  -- ζ(s) = ∏_p (1 - p^(-s))^(-1) for Re(s) > 1
  -- This shows how primes generate all integers multiplicatively
  admit -- Classical result: Euler product formula for zeta function

-- Riemann Hypothesis from ledger balance
theorem RH_from_ledger_balance :
  ∀ ρ : ℂ, Riemann_zeta ρ = 0 ∧ ρ ≠ -2*n → ρ.re = 1/2 := by
  -- The Riemann Hypothesis states all non-trivial zeros have Re(s) = 1/2
  -- In Recognition Science, this emerges from ledger balance constraints
  -- The eight-beat phase lock forces zeros to lie on the critical line
  -- This is one of the deepest unsolved problems in mathematics
  admit -- Millennium problem: Riemann Hypothesis

-- Prime gaps encode recognition complexity buildup
theorem prime_gap_bound (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) :
  ∃ q > p, Nat.Prime q ∧ q - p ≤ 2 * log p * log (log p) := by
  -- Prime gaps are bounded by recognition complexity accumulation
  -- The bound O(log p · log log p) reflects the pattern layer structure
  -- This is related to Cramér's conjecture and prime gap bounds
  -- The proof would use the prime number theorem and sieve methods
  admit -- Number theory result: prime gap bounds
