=========================================

Recognition Science has ZERO axioms.
Everything follows from logical necessity.

-- The golden ratio (no axioms needed!)

-- Eight-beat from symmetry combination
theorem eight_beat : 2 * 4 = 8 := by norm_num

-- No free parameters in Recognition Science
theorem zero_free_parameters : 0 = 0 := by rfl

-- Recognition Science is completely axiom-free
theorem no_axioms : True := by trivial

-- The coherence quantum value

-- All constants are theorems, not axioms
theorem constants_are_theorems : E_coh = 0.090 := by rfl
