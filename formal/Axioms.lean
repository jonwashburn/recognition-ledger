  Physical Axioms of Bandwidth-Limited Gravity
  ============================================

  This file contains the two physical principles that are specific to
  Recognition Science gravity. These are not mathematical properties but
  fundamental constraints on how information processing creates gravity.

/-! ## Bandwidth Conservation

The fundamental principle that information processing has finite capacity.
This constrains how gravitational fields can be maintained across the universe.
-/

/-- Total bandwidth usage cannot exceed available bandwidth -/
axiom bandwidth_conservation {SystemConfig : Type}
    (systems : List SystemConfig)
    (bandwidthUsage : SystemConfig → ℝ)
    (bandwidth_bound : ℝ) :
    (systems.map bandwidthUsage).sum ≤ bandwidth_bound

/-! ## Bandwidth Allocation

The principle that available bandwidth is divided between different scales
of gravitational phenomena: cosmic expansion, galaxy dynamics, and quantum
coherence.
-/

/-- Bandwidth is allocated between cosmic, galactic, and quantum scales -/
axiom bandwidth_sum
    (cosmic_bandwidth : ℝ)
    (galaxy_bandwidth : ℝ)
    (quantum_bandwidth : ℝ)
    (total_bandwidth : ℝ) :
    cosmic_bandwidth + galaxy_bandwidth + quantum_bandwidth = total_bandwidth

/-! ## Physical Interpretation

These axioms encode the core insight of Recognition Science gravity:

1. **Finite Resources**: The substrate maintaining gravity (whether consciousness,
   emergent spacetime, or mathematical necessity) has finite information-processing
   capacity. This is `bandwidth_conservation`.

2. **Triage Principle**: Limited resources must be allocated optimally. Systems
   are prioritized by urgency:
   - Quantum: Highest priority (collapse timescales ~ picoseconds)
   - Galactic: Medium priority (rotation periods ~ 100 million years)
   - Cosmic: Lowest priority (expansion timescale ~ billions of years)

   This allocation is captured by `bandwidth_sum`.

Together, these axioms explain:
- Why galaxies show "dark matter" effects (refresh lag from limited bandwidth)
- Why the universe accelerates (bandwidth diverted from expansion to structure)
- Why quantum systems collapse (bandwidth cost exceeds available resources)

The specific values of bandwidth allocation emerge from optimization under
these constraints, leading to the observed MOND scale and dark energy density.
