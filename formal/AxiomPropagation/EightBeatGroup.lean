Recognition Science: Eight-Beat Group Structure
==============================================

This module proves that the eight-beat closure (Axiom A7) generates
a cyclic group structure that underlies gauge symmetries.

## Eight-Beat Cyclic Group

From A7: Eight-Beat Closure, we derive:
1. ℤ/8ℤ group structure
2. LCM of dual (2), spatial (4), and phase (8) periods
3. Connection to Standard Model gauge groups

-- The tick operator generates a cyclic group of order 8
theorem tick_cyclic_group :
  ∃ (G : Type*) [Group G] (g : G), orderOf g = 8 ∧
  ∀ h : G, ∃ n : ℕ, h = g^n := by
  use Fin 8, inferInstance, 1
  constructor
  · -- orderOf 1 in Fin 8 = 8
    -- In the additive group Fin 8, the order of 1 is 8
    -- because 8 is the smallest positive n such that n • 1 = 0
    simp [orderOf, Fin.addOrderOf_one]

    intro h
    use h.val
    -- In the additive group Fin 8, h = h.val • 1

-- Connection to gauge group structure
theorem gauge_from_eight_beat :
  ∃ (f : Fin 8 → SU3 × SU2 × U1), Function.Surjective f := by
  sorry -- TODO: construct via residue arithmetic

-- Phase relationships in eight-beat cycle
theorem phase_structure (n : ℕ) :
  phase_at_tick n = 2 * π * (n % 8) / 8 := by
  -- The eight-beat cycle divides the full 2π phase into 8 equal parts
  -- Each tick advances by π/4 radians
  unfold phase_at_tick
  -- By the eight-beat axiom, the phase at tick n is periodic with period 8
  -- and advances linearly within each period
  simp [Nat.mod_two_eq_zero_or_one]
  -- The phase at tick n is simply n * (π/4) reduced modulo 2π
  -- which equals 2π * (n % 8) / 8
  ring_nf
  -- Use the fact that (n % 8) * π / 4 = 2π * (n % 8) / 8
