Recognition Science: Cost Inequalities from Axiom A3
=====================================================

This module derives fundamental inequalities from the Positivity of Recognition Cost axiom.
These inequalities underpin entropy bounds, Landauer's principle, and No-Free-Lunch theorems.

## Fundamental Cost Properties

From A3: Positivity of Recognition Cost, we derive:
1. Entropy bounds
2. Landauer's principle
3. No computational free lunch
4. Arrow of time

-- The cost functional is convex
theorem cost_convex : Convex ℝ (Set.range cost) := by
  -- The cost function C(s) is convex because it represents minimum energy
  -- required for recognition, which satisfies the triangle inequality
  apply convex_range_of_convex
  intro s₁ s₂ t h_t_mem h_t_one
  -- For any convex combination t*s₁ + (1-t)*s₂
  -- The cost satisfies C(t*s₁ + (1-t)*s₂) ≤ t*C(s₁) + (1-t)*C(s₂)
  -- This follows from the subadditivity of recognition costs
  apply cost_subadditive_bound
  exact ⟨h_t_mem, h_t_one⟩

-- Entropy is bounded by recognition cost
theorem entropy_cost_bound (s : LedgerState) :
  entropy s ≤ log (cost s / E_coh + 1) := by
  sorry -- TODO: derive from cost positivity

-- Landauer's principle emerges from recognition cost
theorem landauer_principle (bit_erasure : LedgerState → LedgerState)
  (h_erase : ∀ s₁ s₂, bit_erasure s₁ = bit_erasure s₂) :
  ∃ s, cost (bit_erasure s) - cost s ≥ E_coh * log 2 := by
  sorry -- TODO: prove minimum dissipation

-- No Free Lunch: any computation costs at least E_coh
theorem no_free_lunch (compute : LedgerState → LedgerState)
  (h_nontrivial : ∃ s, compute s ≠ s) :
  ∃ s, cost (compute s) - cost s ≥ E_coh := by
  sorry -- TODO: derive from A3

-- Arrow of time from monotonic cost increase
theorem arrow_of_time (tick : LedgerState → LedgerState)
  (h_tick : ∀ s, cost (tick s) ≥ cost s) :
  ¬∃ n : ℕ, ∀ s, tick^[n] s = s := by
  sorry -- TODO: prove no exact recurrence
