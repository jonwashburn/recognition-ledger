  Recognition Science: Detailed Axiom Proofs
  =========================================

  This file provides detailed proofs showing how each axiom
  emerges from the meta-principle "Nothing cannot recognize itself"

  We use a constructive approach, building up from the
  impossibility of self-recognition of nothing.

  intro time_model h

      -- Therefore sum > 0
      Looking at the context, I can see this is about proving that a sum of positive costs is positive. Based on the pattern and the comment mentioning `List.sum_pos`, here's the proof:
