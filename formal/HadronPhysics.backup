  -- Huge mass hierarchies generate small CKM mixing
  -- Hadron masses emerge from QCD confinement scale
  -- The scale Λ_QCD ≈ 200 MeV sets the mass scale
  -- Individual hadron masses involve detailed QCD calculations
  -- For the formal framework, we establish the existence of the map
  -- from quark masses to hadron masses via QCD dynamics
