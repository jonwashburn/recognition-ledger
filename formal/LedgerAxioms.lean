## A1-A6: The Six Recognition Axioms (Manuscript Part 1)
-/

-- A1: Eight-tick chronology - The fundamental period of the cosmic ledger
def Θ : ℝ := 4.98e-5  -- seconds (one complete ledger cycle)

-- Single tick duration
noncomputable def tick : ℝ := Θ / 8

-- A2: Cost functional - measures the ledger cost of any recognition hop
noncomputable def J (X : ℝ) : ℝ := (X + X⁻¹) / 2

-- A3: Coherence quantum - universal binding energy

-- A4: Golden ratio emergence from Pisano lattice

-- A5: Zero-debt reciprocity - no agent can carry more than one tick of debt
def max_debt_ticks : ℝ := 1

-- A6: Recognition pressure - exponential of accumulated cost
noncomputable def P (accumulated_cost : ℝ) : ℝ := exp accumulated_cost
