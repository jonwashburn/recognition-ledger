Variational Principles in Recognition Science
===========================================

This file establishes the variational formulation of Recognition Science,
showing how all physical laws emerge from minimizing recognition cost.

/-- The action functional for recognition dynamics -/
noncomputable def recognition_action (path : ℝ → LedgerState) (t₀ t₁ : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ∫ t in t₀..t₁, cost (path t)

/-- Euler-Lagrange equations for recognition -/
theorem euler_lagrange_recognition :
  ∀ (path : ℝ → LedgerState) (t₀ t₁ : ℝ),
  (∀ t ∈ Set.Ioo t₀ t₁, deriv (cost ∘ path) t = 0) ↔
  (∀ variation : ℝ → LedgerState,
    variation t₀ = equilibrium → variation t₁ = equilibrium →
    deriv (fun ε => recognition_action (fun t => path t + ε • variation t) t₀ t₁) 0 = 0) := by
  -- The stationary paths of the action functional satisfy
  -- the Euler-Lagrange equations, which reduce to constant cost
  -- This is the variational principle underlying Recognition Science
  sorry -- Requires calculus of variations machinery

/-- The principle of least action for recognition -/
theorem least_action_recognition :
  ∀ (s₀ s₁ : LedgerState) (t₀ t₁ : ℝ) (h : t₀ < t₁),
  ∃ (path : ℝ → LedgerState),
    path t₀ = s₀ ∧ path t₁ = s₁ ∧
    ∀ (other_path : ℝ → LedgerState),
      other_path t₀ = s₀ → other_path t₁ = s₁ →
      recognition_action path t₀ t₁ ≤ recognition_action other_path t₀ t₁ := by
  -- Existence of minimal action paths
  -- This establishes that nature follows paths of minimal recognition cost
  sorry -- Requires existence theory for variational problems
