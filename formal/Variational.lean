Variational Principles in Recognition Science
===========================================

This file establishes the variational formulation of Recognition Science,
showing how all physical laws emerge from minimizing recognition cost.

KEY INSIGHT: The variational principles reduce to algebraic conservation laws
when expressed in ledger variables. The fundamental identity is:
  Δ ≡ Σ (debit - credit) = 0 for every admissible variation

SIMPLIFICATION: In Recognition Science, physical paths are those that maintain
ledger balance at all times. This makes the variational principles algebraic
rather than analytic.
