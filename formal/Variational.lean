/-- Variation of a path -/
def path_variation (path : ℝ → LedgerState) (variation : ℝ → LedgerState) (ε : ℝ) : ℝ → LedgerState :=
  fun t => path t + ε • variation t

  · -- Forward direction: stationary cost implies vanishing first variation
    intro h_stationary variation h_var_t₀ h_var_t₁
    unfold first_variation recognition_action path_variation
    -- The derivative of the action with respect to ε at ε=0
    -- involves the integral of cost'(path(t)) · variation(t)
    -- Since cost'(path(t)) = 0 by h_stationary, this integral vanishes
    sorry -- Technical: requires Leibniz integral rule
  · -- Reverse direction: vanishing first variation implies stationary cost
    intro h_variation t ht
    -- By choosing specific test variations that are nonzero only near t,
    -- we can show that cost'(path(t)) must vanish
    -- This is the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations
    sorry -- Technical: requires constructing bump functions

/-- The principle of least action for recognition -/

      recognition_action path t₀ t₁ ≤ recognition_action other_path t₀ t₁ := by
  intro s₀ s₁ t₀ t₁ h
  -- The minimal path exists by compactness and continuity arguments
  -- In Recognition Science, this is the path of constant cost

    -- The equilibrium path has constant (minimal) cost
    -- Any other path has cost ≥ cost(equilibrium)
    unfold recognition_action
    -- Use that cost(equilibrium) ≤ cost(s) for all s
    sorry -- Requires monotonicity of integral

/-- Noether's theorem for recognition symmetries -/
theorem noether_recognition (symmetry : LedgerState → LedgerState)
  (h_sym : ∀ s, cost (symmetry s) = cost s) :
  ∃ (conserved : LedgerState → ℝ),
    ∀ (path : ℝ → LedgerState),
      (∀ t, deriv (cost ∘ path) t = 0) →
      (∀ t, deriv (conserved ∘ path) t = 0) := by
  -- Symmetries of the cost function lead to conserved quantities
  -- This is how conservation laws emerge from recognition principles
  use fun s => inner s (symmetry s - s)  -- Placeholder conserved quantity
  intro path h_euler_lagrange t
  -- The conserved quantity is constant along solutions
  sorry -- Requires differential geometry machinery
