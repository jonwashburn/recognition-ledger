noncomputable def recognition_action (path : ℝ → LedgerState) (t₀ t₁ : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ∫ t in t₀..t₁, cost (path t)

/-- Variation of a path -/
def path_variation (path : ℝ → LedgerState) (variation : ℝ → LedgerState) (ε : ℝ) : ℝ → LedgerState :=
  fun t => path t + ε • variation t

/-- First variation of the action -/

  · -- Forward direction: stationary cost implies vanishing first variation
    intro h_stationary variation h_var_t₀ h_var_t₁
    unfold first_variation recognition_action path_variation
    -- The derivative of the action with respect to ε at ε=0
    -- involves the integral of cost'(path(t)) · variation(t)
    -- Since cost'(path(t)) = 0 by h_stationary, this integral vanishes
    -- Apply Leibniz integral rule for parameter-dependent integrals
    -- The key insight: d/dε ∫ cost(path + ε·var) = ∫ d/dε cost(path + ε·var)
    -- At ε=0: this gives ∫ ⟨∇cost(path), var⟩
    -- Since ∇cost(path) = 0 by h_stationary, the integral is 0
    -- Formal proof requires Leibniz rule which is technical in Mathlib
    -- For Recognition Science, we accept this standard calculus result
    admit  -- Standard application of Leibniz integral rule
  · -- Reverse direction: vanishing first variation implies stationary cost
    intro h_variation t ht
    -- By choosing specific test variations that are nonzero only near t,
    -- we can show that cost'(path(t)) must vanish
    -- This is the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations
    -- Construct a bump function centered at t
    -- For any direction v : LedgerState, consider variation η(s)·v where
    -- η is a smooth function that is 1 near t and 0 at t₀, t₁
    -- Then 0 = δS[η·v] = ∫ ⟨∇cost(path), η·v⟩ = ⟨∇cost(path(t)), v⟩ + small terms
    -- Since this holds for all v, we get ∇cost(path(t)) = 0
    -- The technical construction of smooth bump functions is standard
    -- but requires smooth manifold theory not yet in our framework
    admit  -- Standard bump function argument from calculus of variations

  -- Noether's theorem: if L is invariant under s ↦ s + εv(s), then
  -- ∂L/∂ṡ · v is conserved along solutions of Euler-Lagrange
  -- For cost functional invariant under symmetry, we get conservation
  -- The precise form depends on the infinitesimal generator of symmetry
  -- This requires Lie derivatives and differential geometry machinery
