# Biology from Recognition Science

This directory derives biological phenomena from recognition principles.

## Structure

### ProteinFolding/
Resolves Levinthal's paradox with picosecond folding:
- `FoldingTime.lean` - Proves τ_fold = N_cascades × 8 × τ_handoff × η
- `IRGuidance.lean` - 13.8 μm photons guide folding (planned)
- `ChiralSelection.lean` - L-amino acid preference (planned)

### CellularClock/
Cells as 8-channel optical computers:
- `IRClock.lean` - 21.7 THz cellular frequency
- `MetabolicPhase.lean` - ATP synthesis synchronization (planned)
- `CytoskeletonWaveguide.lean` - Optical properties (planned)

### EvolutionDynamics/ (planned)
- `FitnessLandscape.lean` - Recognition cost optimization
- `SpeciationEvents.lean` - Phase transitions in morphospace
- `ConvergentEvolution.lean` - Forced by ledger constraints

## Key Insights

1. **Picosecond biology** - Life operates at recognition timescale
2. **Optical computing** - Cells use IR photons for coordination
3. **Phase coherence** - Health = maintained phase relationships
4. **Evolution** - Optimizes recognition efficiency
