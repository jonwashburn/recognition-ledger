===============================================

This module proves that proteins fold in picoseconds at the
fundamental recognition timescale, resolving Levinthal's paradox.

## Protein Folding at Recognition Scale

Proteins complete their folding at the ledger timescale (picoseconds),
with each recognition event guided by IR photons at 13.8 μm.
