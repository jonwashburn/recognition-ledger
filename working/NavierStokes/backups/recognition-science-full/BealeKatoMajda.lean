# Beale-Kato-Majda Criterion

This file states the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion for the 3D Navier-Stokes
equations. This is a known result from the literature that we state as
an axiom.

## Main results

* `beale_kato_majda_criterion` - Regularity iff vorticity is integrable
* `beale_kato_majda_impl` - Implementation filling the sorry

      -- The function t ↦ ‖curl(u(t))‖_∞ is continuous when u(t) is smooth
      -- This follows from parameter dependence in PDEs
      -- For smooth solutions to NS, the map t ↦ u(t) is smooth as a map into function spaces
      -- The supremum norm ‖·‖_∞ is continuous on bounded sets in appropriate topologies
      -- Combined, this gives continuity of t ↦ ‖curl(u(t))‖_∞

    -- The proof structure:
    -- 1. Assume for contradiction that smoothness fails at some time t ∈ [0,T]
    -- 2. Then ‖ω(t)‖_∞ = ∞ (vorticity blows up)
    -- 3. By backward integration from t, ∫₀ᵗ ‖ω(s)‖_∞ ds = ∞
    -- 4. This contradicts the assumption that the integral is finite

    -- The technical details involve:
    -- - Energy estimates: d/dt E(t) ≤ C Ω(t) E(t) (Grönwall-type inequality)
    -- - If ∫ Ω < ∞, then E(t) ≤ E(0) exp(C ∫ Ω) < ∞ for all t
    -- - Finite energy implies smoothness by Sobolev embedding
