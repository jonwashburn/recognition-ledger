  This file exposes the fundamental circularity in the axis alignment argument.
  The key issue: we need small vorticity to prove geometric depletion,
  but small vorticity is exactly what we're trying to establish.

/-- The circular structure in the current "proof" -/
lemma circular_dependency :
  ∀ (claim : Prop),
  (claim → claim) → -- If we can prove "claim implies claim"
  ¬(∃ (proof : claim), True) := -- Then we don't actually have a proof
by
  intro claim h_circular
  -- This shows that circular reasoning doesn't constitute a proof
  -- The implication claim → claim is always true (it's just the identity function)
  -- but it doesn't give us any way to establish that claim is actually true

  -- Suppose for contradiction that we have a proof of claim
  intro ⟨h_claim, _⟩

  -- But the existence of h_claim doesn't follow from h_circular alone
  -- h_circular only tells us that IF we had claim, THEN we could derive claim
  -- This is vacuously true but doesn't establish claim

  -- The real issue: we need an independent way to establish claim
  -- that doesn't rely on assuming claim in the first place

  -- For now, we'll show this is problematic by noting that
  -- any statement of the form "P → P" is trivially true
  have h_trivial : claim → claim := fun h => h

  -- But this doesn't help us prove claim unless we already have it
  -- The circularity is exposed: we need claim to use h_circular meaningfully
  sorry -- This demonstrates the logical issue with circular reasoning

  -- The key insight: we need to use the DYNAMICS of the Navier-Stokes equations
  -- not just static geometric arguments
