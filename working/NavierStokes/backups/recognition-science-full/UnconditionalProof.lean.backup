# Unconditional Global Regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes – Scaffold

This file mirrors the structure of the paper *Navier-Stokes-v9-unconditional.txt*.
All *axioms* that previously appeared in the codebase are replaced here by
regular `lemma`/`theorem` declarations with `sorry` proofs.  These declarations
serve as **targets** to be filled in future development, while maintaining a
single, central location for the remaining gaps.

Nothing in this file is assumed without proof – every mathematical claim is
presented as a goal.

  Looking at the context, I can see that the `eight_beat_alignment` lemma is incomplete - it's missing its conclusion/goal statement. The lemma declaration ends abruptly after the hypotheses without specifying what needs to be proven.

Since the lemma statement is incomplete and there's no goal specified, the appropriate response is:

sorry

  Looking at the context, I can see that `universal_vorticity_bound` is incomplete - it's missing its conclusion and the proof. Based on the comment and the pattern of other lemmas, this should be a bound on the vorticity (curl of velocity field) in terms of `C_star` and the viscosity parameter `ν`.

However, since the lemma statement is incomplete (missing the conclusion after the colon), I cannot provide a valid proof. The lemma needs to be completed first with its proper conclusion, such as:

```lean
‖curl u x‖ ≤ C_star / Real.sqrt ν
```

Without the complete lemma statement, I cannot provide a proof term.

lemma improved_geometric_depletion
    {u : VectorField} {x : _} {r : ℝ} (h : 0 < r) :
    ‖∇ u x‖ ≤ C₀ / r := by
  sorry

  Looking at the context, I can see that `drift_threshold` is an incomplete lemma definition. The lemma starts with a `let` binding but doesn't have a conclusion to prove. 

Since there's no actual goal to prove (the lemma is malformed), the appropriate response is:

```lean
sorry
  ```lean
{p : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ} {t₁ t₂ : ℝ} {x y : _} {ν : ℝ} 
    (hν : 0 < ν) (ht : t₁ < t₂) (hp_pos : 0 < p t₁ x) :

/-- Universal scale-invariant vorticity bound `‖ω‖ ≤ C*/√ν`. -/
  Looking at the context, I can see several lemmas with `sorry` placeholders, but there's no specific lemma statement provided for me to prove. The prompt mentions "The lemma to prove is: sorry" but doesn't show the actual lemma statement.

Since I need to provide a proof term or tactic sequence to replace a `sorry`, and without seeing the specific lemma statement to prove, I can only provide:

sorry
  Looking at the context, I can see several lemmas but no actual lemma statement to prove - just a `sorry` at the end. Since there's no lemma statement provided, I cannot give a meaningful proof.

However, based on the pattern of the other lemmas in the context, if this is meant to be a trivial lemma or placeholder, the most appropriate response would be:

sorry

  Looking at the lemma signature, I need to prove an inequality involving the supremum norm of the curl of a vector field `u`. Based on the context and the pattern of other lemmas, this appears to be establishing a bound using the bootstrap constant `K_star`.
