# Recognition Science Full Implementation Backup

## Important: This is a Checkpoint

**Date**: December 2024  
**Git Tag**: `v1.0-recognition-science-full`  
**Backup Location**: `backups/recognition-science-full/`

## What This Contains

This backup contains the FULL Recognition Science implementation including:

### Mathematical Components
- Complete Navier-Stokes proof attempt with 76 sorries
- Biot-Savart kernel estimates with C_BS = 0.05
- Beale-Kato-Majda criterion enhancement
- Vorticity bound proofs
- Bootstrap mechanisms

### Recognition Science Framework
- Eight-beat cosmic cycle
- Voxel dynamics and axis alignment
- Prime fusion theory (45-gap)
- Consciousness emergence theory
- Ledger imbalance as time
- Experience vs computation dichotomy

### Key Constants
- C* = 0.05 (geometric depletion)
- φ⁻¹ ≈ 0.618 (golden ratio bound)
- K* = 0.090 (bootstrap constant)
- 8 angular sectors (axis alignment)

## Why We're Simplifying

We're temporarily removing the Recognition Science narrative to:
1. Get a clean, buildable Lean proof
2. Eliminate all 76 sorries systematically
3. Fix circular dependencies
4. Replace axioms with mathlib imports
5. Make the proof independently verifiable

## How to Restore

```bash
# Method 1: From Git Tag
git checkout v1.0-recognition-science-full

# Method 2: From Backup
cp -r backups/recognition-science-full/* NavierStokesLedger/

# Method 3: View specific files
git show v1.0-recognition-science-full:NavierStokesLedger/AxisAlignment.lean
```

## Future Integration Plan

Once the minimal mathematical proof is complete:
1. Create `NavierStokesLedger/RecognitionScience/` subdirectory
2. Move philosophical components there
3. Keep core math separate but connected
4. Document the interpretation layer clearly

## Remember

The Recognition Science framework is not being abandoned - it's being temporarily set aside to achieve a clean mathematical proof first. The philosophical insights remain valid and will be reintegrated once we have a verified core.
