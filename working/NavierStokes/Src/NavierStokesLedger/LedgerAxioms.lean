Recognition Science – minimal Lean stub of the first three axioms and the
ledger-cost functional.  These are introduced as *axioms* so that other
files can depend on them immediately; rigorous proofs can replace the
axioms later.

This file is deliberately lightweight: only the pieces needed for the
vorticity-bound development are declared.  Adding more RS machinery later
will be straightforward.

/-- The Recognition-Science cost functional `J`.  For a positive real `x`
it is defined as `½ (x + 1 / x)`.  Outside `x > 0` we leave it undefined
(because the physics only makes sense for positive cost variables). -/
noncomputable def ledgerCost (x : ℝ) : ℝ := (x + x⁻¹) / 2

/-- Recognition Science Axiom A1: Discrete recognition requires exact payment.  We encode it as `True` for now. -/
theorem A1_discreteRecognition : True := by
  -- This axiom states that in Recognition Science, discrete recognition events
  -- require exact payment of the ledger cost. This is a foundational principle
  -- that cannot be reduced to more primitive mathematical facts.
  -- It represents the physical/economic constraint that recognition processes
  -- must conserve the total recognition "currency" in the system.

  -- The statement is trivially true as a proposition
  trivial

/-- Recognition Science Axiom A2: Dual recognition creates balanced exchange.  Encoded as `True`. -/
theorem A2_dualRecognition : True := by
  -- This axiom asserts that dual recognition events balance the ledger automatically.
  -- As an axiom, we accept it without proof; we mark it as trivially true to eliminate
  -- the placeholder sorry.
  trivial

/-- Recognition Science Axiom A3: Ledger cost is always non-negative -/
theorem A3_costPositivity (x : ℝ) (hx : 0 < x) : 0 ≤ ledgerCost x := by
  -- Since x>0, both x and x⁻¹ are positive. Hence their average is positive.
