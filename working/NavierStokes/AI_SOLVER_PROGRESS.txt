# AI Solver Progress Report

## Summary
- AI solver infrastructure complete with comprehensive Recognition Science context
- Initial attempts with Claude 3.5 Sonnet yielded 0 successful proofs
- OpenAI o3 model configured and tested - also 0 successful proofs
- Project needs human-guided proof completion
- 59 sorries remain

## Key Findings

### What Was Done
1. Created custom Navier-Stokes solver with full Recognition Science framework
2. Integrated all 8 axioms and derived constants (C₀ = 0.02, C* = 0.142, etc.)
3. Included eight-beat vorticity alignment mechanism
4. Attempted automatic proof generation on 5 key files
5. Set up OpenAI o3 model with proper API configuration

### OpenAI o3 Setup
- Created navier_stokes_rs_solver_o3.py 
- Configured for OpenAI API (model name: "o3")
- Note: o3 doesn't support temperature parameter
- Uses max_completion_tokens instead of max_tokens
- API key provided by user integrated

### Results
- Total LLM calls: 88 (36 Claude + 52 o3 attempts)
- Successful proofs: 0
- All attempts failed due to compilation errors
- Project builds successfully despite sorries

### Key Issues
1. Complex custom definitions in BasicDefinitions.lean
2. Many fundamental proofs are axiomatized
3. AI cannot infer correct proof structure without more context
4. Type mismatches in generated proofs

### Recommendation
Use AI for proof strategies, not complete automatic proofs. The Recognition Science context is comprehensive but the Lean 4 formalization requires human expertise to complete.

### What Didn't Work
1. **Generic AI proof generation** - The proofs generated didn't compile
2. **Automatic tactics** - Avoided as requested (would break project)
3. **Bulk solving** - Too many failures, need more targeted approach

### Why AI Proofs Failed
1. **Complex dependencies** - Our definitions use custom Recognition Science constants
2. **Missing imports** - Generated proofs may assume lemmas not yet proven
3. **Type mismatches** - AI doesn't fully understand our custom types
4. **Axiomatized definitions** - Many core definitions still use `sorry`

### What We Need
1. **Bottom-up approach** - Complete foundational definitions first
2. **Manual guidance** - AI needs more specific proof sketches
3. **Incremental progress** - One proof at a time with validation
4. **Better context** - Include more file dependencies in prompts

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Fix foundational sorries** in PDEOperators.lean (like L2NormSquared)
2. **Complete basic lemmas** that don't depend on complex machinery
3. **Use AI for proof sketches** rather than complete proofs
4. **Manually refine** AI suggestions to ensure compilation

### Modified Strategy
Instead of automated solving:
1. Use AI to suggest proof strategies
2. Manually implement with proper types/imports
3. Test each proof individually
4. Build up from simpler to complex proofs

### Recognition Science Integration
The custom solver now includes:
- Eight axioms and their implications
- Key constants (C₀=0.02, C*=0.142, K*=0.090)
- Eight-beat vorticity alignment mechanism
- Voxel walk methodology
- Ledger balance principles

This context helps AI understand the framework but isn't sufficient for automatic proof generation without human guidance.
