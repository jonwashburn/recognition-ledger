DELIVERABLE B SUMMARY: Cosmic Gravity Test
==========================================

Objective
---------
Show that LNAL gravity with running G and information field can reproduce 
the observed effective matter density Ω_m,eff ≈ 0.31 without cold dark matter.

Parameter Chain from RS Axioms
------------------------------
λ_micro = 9.12×10⁻³⁶ m (Planck pixel)
f = 3.3×10⁻¹²² (sparsity)
λ_eff = 21.4 μm (recognition hop length)
β = -0.0557 (running G exponent)

Key Physics
-----------
The LNAL gravity modification proposes:
G_eff(r) = G_Newton × (r/λ_eff)^|β| for r > λ_eff

This creates enhanced gravity on large scales that could mimic dark matter.

Results
-------
1. Solar System (Deliverable A): ✓ SUCCESS
   - Max deviation |Δg/g| < 10⁻¹⁷ 
   - LNAL indistinguishable from Newtonian gravity

2. Cosmic Scales (Deliverable B): PARTIAL SUCCESS
   - With β ≈ 0.056, enhancement is very weak
   - Maximum achievable Ω_m,eff ≈ 0.10 (vs target 0.31)
   - Would need β ≈ 0.5-1.0 for sufficient enhancement

Possible Resolutions
--------------------
1. Different λ_eff interpretation:
   - The 21.4 μm from axioms might apply to quantum scales
   - Recognition lengths L₁ = 0.97 kpc, L₂ = 24.3 kpc from galaxy analysis
   - These provide more natural transition scales

2. Modified running G formula:
   - Current: G ∝ (r/λ)^|β| gives weak enhancement
   - Alternative: G ∝ exp(|β|r/λ) or other functional forms
   - May arise from more detailed ledger bandwidth calculations

3. Additional information field effects:
   - Direct contribution from information density gradients
   - Non-linear coupling between matter and information fields
   - Could provide additional effective mass

4. Scale-dependent β:
   - β might run with scale itself
   - Different values for galactic vs cosmic scales

Physical Interpretation
-----------------------
The cosmic ledger has finite bandwidth for processing gravitational 
information. On scales larger than the recognition length λ_eff:

- Information must hop through intermediate recognition events
- This creates latency and effective mass from information in transit
- The effect mimics dark matter without exotic particles

Even with current limitations, the framework successfully:
- Maintains Newtonian gravity in Solar System
- Explains galaxy rotation curves (previous work)  
- Provides conceptual unification of dark phenomena

Next Steps
----------
1. Refine the running G formula based on first principles
2. Compute information field contribution explicitly
3. Test against CMB and large scale structure data
4. Develop full Boltzmann code implementation

Conclusion
----------
While the current implementation doesn't fully reproduce Ω_m,eff ≈ 0.31,
the LNAL framework provides a promising avenue for explaining dark matter
through information-theoretic gravity modifications. The single parameter
chain from Planck scale successfully constrains the theory and makes
testable predictions.
