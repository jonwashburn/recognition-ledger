# Recognition Science

This repository contains implementations and research projects based on Recognition Science principles, a framework that unifies physics through information-theoretic constraints and golden ratio geometry.

## Projects

### 1. Recognition Framework (`recognition-framework/`)
The foundational Lean framework for Recognition Science, providing formal proofs and core principles based on golden ratio geometry and information theory.

### 2. LNAL Gravity Theory (`gravity/`)
Light-Native Assembly Language (LNAL) gravity theory - a parameter-free approach to galactic dynamics that achieves χ²/N ≈ 1.04 across 175 SPARC galaxies without dark matter.

**Key Features:**
- Zero free parameters
- Based on golden ratio geometry (φ = 1.618...)
- Cosmic ledger hypothesis: 1% universal overhead
- Explains galactic rotation curves without dark matter
- Predicts dark energy from accumulated ledger debt

### 3. Riemann Hypothesis (`RiemannHypothesis/`)
Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis using Recognition Science principles and complex log-periodicity.
