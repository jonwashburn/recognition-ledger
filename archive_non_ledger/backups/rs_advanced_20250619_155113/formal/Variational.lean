Variational Principle for Vacuum Occupancy
=========================================

This file will eventually supply the full Euler–Lagrange derivation of
the vacuum filling fraction
    f_occupancy = 3.3 × 10⁻¹²²
from the recognition–action functional.  For now we record the result
as an axiom so that other parts of the project can depend on a concrete
statement without introducing new `sorry`s.
