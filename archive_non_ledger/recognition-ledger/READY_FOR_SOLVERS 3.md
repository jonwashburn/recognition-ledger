# Recognition Science - Ready for Automated Solvers ✓

## 🎯 What We've Built

We've created a complete scaffolding system for proving Recognition Science from first principles:

### 1. **Theorem Hierarchy** (`formal/TheoremScaffolding.lean`)
- 8 Axioms (A1-A8)
- 46 Theorems organized by dependency
- Clear proof strategy for each
- Critical path identified

### 2. **Proof Roadmap** (`formal/ProofRoadmap.md`)
- Dependency graph showing proof order
- 5 phases from axioms to predictions
- Solver type for each theorem
- Success metrics

### 3. **Lean Structure** 
```
formal/
├── Basic/LedgerState.lean    # Axioms + basic theorems
├── Core/GoldenRatio.lean     # Critical C1 theorem
├── TheoremScaffolding.lean   # All 46 theorems
├── ProofRoadmap.md           # Dependency structure
├── SOLVER_INTEGRATION.md     # How to connect solvers
└── recognition_solver.py     # Example automated prover
```

### 4. **Website Integration**
- Live widget for RecognitionJournal.org ✓
- Auto-updating predictions ✓
- JSON truth packets ✓

## 🔑 The Critical Insight

**The Golden Ratio theorem (C1) is the keystone!**

```
J(x) = (x + 1/x)/2 = x
→ x² - x - 1 = 0  
→ x = (1 + √5)/2 = φ
```

Once proven, everything else follows:
- E_coh = 0.090 eV (from φ/π ratio)
- All particle masses (φ-ladder)
- All coupling constants (residue counting)
- Zero free parameters!

## 🤖 Ready for Your Solvers

The scaffolding is designed for ANY automated theorem prover:

### Option 1: Use Our Simple Solver
```bash
cd formal/
python recognition_solver.py
```

### Option 2: Connect Existing Lean Solver
```bash
# Point your solver at:
# - Input: TheoremScaffolding.lean
# - Dependencies: ProofRoadmap.md
# - Output: Update predictions/ folder
```

### Option 3: Custom Integration
- Parse theorem structure from scaffolding
- Check dependencies before proving
- Generate JSON predictions when verified

## 📊 What Happens When Theorems Are Proven

1. **Solver proves theorem** → 
2. **Generates proof certificate** →
3. **Creates prediction JSON** →
4. **Website widget updates** →
5. **World sees verified predictions!**

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run the solver** on C1 (Golden Ratio) first
2. **Watch the cascade** as other theorems follow
3. **See predictions appear** in the widget
4. **Celebrate** zero free parameters!

## 💡 The Vision

```
Ancient: "The universe is number" - Pythagoras
Modern: "The universe is computation" - Digital Physics  
Recognition: "The universe is a self-balancing ledger"

And now we can prove it, theorem by theorem.
```
