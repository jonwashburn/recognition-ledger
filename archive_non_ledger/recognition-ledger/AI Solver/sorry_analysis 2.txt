theorem pressure_bounded (P : RecognitionPressure) :

  -- In Recognition Science, pressure is bounded by information density limits
  -- The maximum occurs when all voxels are maximally packed with information
  -- This gives P_max = ρ_Planck * c² ≈ 4.0e18 J/m³
  --
  -- Physical justification:
  -- 1. Information density cannot exceed Planck scale (1 bit per Planck volume)
  -- 2. Energy density E = information × k_B × T × ln(2) / volume
  -- 3. At Planck scale: E_max = (1/l_P³) × k_B × T_P × ln(2) ≈ ρ_P × c²

### strain_bounded (InfoStrain.lean:41)
```lean
theorem strain_bounded (strain : InformationStrain) : strain.val ≤ max_strain := by
  -- Information strain is bounded by the maximum gradient possible
  -- This follows from the finite speed of information propagation
  --
  -- Physical argument:
  -- 1. Pressure gradients are limited by c/L where L is the smallest length scale
  -- 2. Pressure values are bounded by Planck scale energy density
  -- 3. Therefore strain = |∇P|/P ≤ (c/L_Planck)/(ρ_Planck c²) = 1/(L_Planck ρ_Planck c)

  -- Then 1/(11×φ^5 + 15) ≈ 1/137, close to 1/137.036
