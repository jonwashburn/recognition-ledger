UNIFIED BANDWIDTH GRAVITY DOCUMENT - REVIEW SUMMARY
=================================================

IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED:

1. RESTRUCTURED FOCUS:
   - Changed from general Recognition Science prospectus to focused quantum-gravity unification monograph
   - Title: 'Quantum-Gravity Unification Through Bandwidth-Limited Information Processing'
   - Clear thesis: finite computational substrate explains both quantum and gravitational phenomena

2. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
   - Eight axioms clearly stated with mathematical precision
   - Comprehensive notation section with units
   - Derivation of bandwidth allocation through utility maximization
   - Emergence of MOND scale from first principles (no free parameters)

3. EMPIRICAL GROUNDING:
   - Analysis of 175 SPARC galaxies with median χ²/N = 0.48
   - Five global parameters vs hundreds in dark matter models
   - Special emphasis on dwarf galaxy excellence (χ²/N = 0.16)

4. TECHNICAL CONTENT ADDED:
   Chapter 2: Complete axiomatic framework and notation
   Chapter 3: Full derivation of bandwidth economics and refresh lag
   Chapter 4: Field equations embedding in general relativity
   Chapter 5: Detailed galaxy rotation curve methodology

5. DOCUMENT STRUCTURE:
   Part I: Foundations (philosophical motivation, axioms)
   Part II: Derivation (bandwidth theory, field equations, galaxy analysis)
   Part III: Empirical Tests (placeholder for pulsars, lensing, waves)
   Part IV: Quantum Unification (placeholder for collapse, Born rule)
   Part V: Prospects (placeholder for implications)

REMAINING IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:

1. Complete placeholder chapters (6, 7, 8, 9)
2. Fix technical issues (missing label, figure path)
3. Add appendices with detailed calculations
4. Enhance bibliography with recent references
5. Create figures and tables
6. Address physics.sty package issue

The document has transformed from a broad prospectus into a focused scientific monograph proposing a specific solution to quantum-gravity unification through bandwidth-limited information processing.
