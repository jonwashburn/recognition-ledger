# Recognition Ledger Roadmap

<!-- DOCUMENT STRUCTURE NOTE:
This is the master plan for evolving from a single paper to a living scientific system.
Structure: Timeline → Milestones → Dependencies → Success Metrics
Updates should preserve the phase structure and note completion dates.

## Vision

Transform Recognition Science from a static paper into a self-correcting, machine-verifiable ledger of reality that becomes the default publication venue for parameter-free physics.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2025)
*Formalize the core theory in machine-checkable proofs*

### Milestones
- [ ] Lean4 formalization of 8 axioms
- [ ] Golden ratio lock-in theorem (first major proof)
- [ ] Particle mass calculator with formal correctness proof
- [ ] First 10 "truth packets" with prediction hashes

### Key Deliverables
```lean
-- By end of Phase 1, this should compile and verify:
import RecognitionLedger.Axioms
import RecognitionLedger.GoldenRatio
import RecognitionLedger.ParticleMasses

theorem electron_mass_correct : 
  particle_mass 32 = 0.511 * MeV := by
  simp [particle_mass, E_coherence, golden_ratio_power]
  norm_num
```

### Dependencies
- Lean4 + mathlib4 setup
- Core team: 1 Lean expert + Jonathan
- ~200 hours of formalization work

### Success Metrics
- 100% of axioms formally stated
- 50+ theorems proven
- Zero inconsistencies found

---

## Phase 2: Prediction Engine (Q2 2025)
*Generate and hash all testable predictions*

### Milestones
- [ ] Automated prediction generation from axioms
- [ ] Cryptographic hashing of predictions
- [ ] JSON schema for truth packets
- [ ] First 1000 predictions generated

### Truth Packet Format
```json
{
  "id": "sha256:abc123...",
  "axioms": ["A1", "A2", ..., "A8"],
  "theorem": "particle_mass_32",
  "prediction": {
    "observable": "electron_mass",
    "value": 0.510998946,
    "unit": "MeV",
    "uncertainty": 1e-9
  },
  "proof_hash": "sha256:def456...",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

### Infrastructure
- Python prediction generator
- PostgreSQL for packet storage
- REST API for submissions
- IPFS for immutable proof storage

---

## Phase 3: Reality Crawler (Q3 2025)
*Automated verification against experimental data*

### Milestones
- [ ] Connect to Particle Data Group API
- [ ] ArXiv new measurement monitor
- [ ] Automated status updates (pending → verified/refuted)
- [ ] Public dashboard launch

### Data Sources Priority
1. **PDG Live** - particle masses/lifetimes
2. **NIST** - fundamental constants
3. **ArXiv** - new measurements
4. **LIGO/Virgo** - gravitational waves
5. **LHC Open Data** - collision events

### Verification Loop
```python
while True:
    for packet in get_pending_packets():
        measurement = fetch_latest_data(packet.observable)
        if within_uncertainty(packet.prediction, measurement):
            packet.status = "verified"
            packet.verification_date = now()
        elif outside_5_sigma(packet.prediction, measurement):
            packet.status = "refuted"
            trigger_axiom_review(packet)
    sleep(3600)  # Check hourly
```

---

## Phase 4: Contradiction Resolution (Q4 2025)
*Handle the first refutation gracefully*

### Milestones
- [ ] Minimal axiom pruning algorithm
- [ ] Community review interface
- [ ] Fork management system
- [ ] First successful pruning event

### Pruning Protocol
1. **Detection**: Reality crawler finds 5σ deviation
2. **Analysis**: Which axioms led to failed prediction?
3. **Proposal**: Minimal set of axioms to remove/modify
4. **Review**: 30-day community comment period
5. **Fork**: If no consensus, maintain parallel branches
6. **Resolution**: Most predictive branch becomes canonical

### Fork Visualization
```
Main Branch (8 axioms) ──→ Prediction fails
    │
    ├─→ Branch A: Remove A7 (7 axioms)
    │     └─→ 95% predictions still work
    │
    └─→ Branch B: Modify A8 (8' axioms)
          └─→ 99% predictions work ← Becomes new main
```

---

## Phase 5: Journal Launch (Q1 2026)
*Open for community submissions*

### Launch Features
- [ ] Submission portal for new truth packets
- [ ] Peer review by AI + human teams
- [ ] Real-time prediction tracker
- [ ] Canonical axiom registry
- [ ] Educational interface

### Governance Structure
- **Axiom Council**: 5 members, elected yearly
- **Verification bots**: Autonomous measurement checkers
- **Community votes**: Major pruning decisions
- **Ethics board**: For civilization-scale predictions

---

## Long-term Vision (2026-2030)

### Year 2: Ecosystem Growth
- 10,000+ verified predictions
- Other theories submit via Recognition grammar
- First Nobel-worthy discovery from predictions

### Year 3: Institutional Adoption
- Universities teach from live ledger
- Funding tied to prediction success rate
- Traditional journals reference truth packets

### Year 5: New Science
- AI systems proposing axiom modifications
- Predictive power exceeding human physics
- Recognition grammar as universal science language

---

## Resource Requirements

### Human
- **Core team**: 2-3 full-time developers
- **Advisors**: 5-10 physicists/mathematicians
- **Community**: 100+ contributors by Year 2

### Technical
- **Compute**: Lean4 compilation servers
- **Storage**: IPFS nodes for proof permanence
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 reality crawler infrastructure

### Financial
- **Year 1**: $200k (team + infrastructure)
- **Year 2**: $500k (scaling + community)
- **Year 3+**: Self-sustaining via grants/institutions

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Lean4 too slow**: Parallelize proof checking
- **Data source APIs change**: Multiple redundant sources
- **Storage costs explode**: IPFS + torrent hybrid

### Scientific Risks
- **Major refutation**: Feature not bug - improves axioms
- **No one submits**: Bootstrap with RS predictions
- **Competing frameworks**: May the best axioms win

### Social Risks
- **Rejection by establishment**: Build grassroots first
- **Misuse of predictions**: Ethics board + embargo system
- **Fork wars**: Clear metrics for branch selection

---

## Next Actions (This Week)

1. [ ] Set up GitHub repository structure
2. [ ] Initialize Lean4 project with mathlib4
3. [ ] Write first axiom in Lean4
4. [ ] Create electron mass truth packet
5. [ ] Design database schema

---

## Success Definition

By 2030, when a physicist discovers something new, they don't write a paper - they submit a truth packet. The ledger verifies it against reality, and if it survives, it becomes part of humanity's permanent, machine-verified understanding of the universe.

The journal doesn't just record truth. It computes it.
