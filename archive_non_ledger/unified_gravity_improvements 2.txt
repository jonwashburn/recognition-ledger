UNIFIED BANDWIDTH GRAVITY - IMPROVEMENT PLAN
==========================================

CURRENT STATUS:
- Document successfully restructured around quantum-gravity unification theme
- Strong mathematical foundation with eight axioms clearly stated
- Galaxy rotation curve analysis well-developed with concrete results
- Good use of Recognition Science bandwidth framework

COMPLETED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Added comprehensive Chapter 2 with:
   - Eight fundamental axioms clearly stated
   - Complete notation table with units
   - Proper mathematical framework established

2. Expanded Chapter 3 with:
   - Detailed derivation of bandwidth allocation
   - Utility maximization framework
   - Emergence of MOND scale from first principles
   - Clear connection between refresh lag and recognition weight

3. Maintained strong empirical grounding:
   - 175 SPARC galaxies analyzed
   - Median χ²/N = 0.48 reported
   - Dwarf galaxy excellence highlighted

REMAINING TASKS:

1. Technical Fixes:
   - Add \label{chap:bandwidth} to Chapter 3
   - Fix abstract typo: 'and outlines' → 'and outline'
   - Create figures/rotation_examples.pdf or update path
   - Verify all citations exist in references.bib

2. Content Additions needed for remaining placeholder chapters

3. Mathematical Rigor improvements

4. Enhanced Citations from recent experiments

5. Figures and Tables to create

6. Appendices to Add for completeness
