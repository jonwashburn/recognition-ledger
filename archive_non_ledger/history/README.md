# LNAL-Gravity

Light-Native Assembly Language (LNAL) gravity research - **Recognition Science implementation of parameter-free galactic gravity theory**.

This repository contains core algorithms and documentation for a novel approach to galactic rotation curves based on Recognition Science principles. The theory derives all gravitational behavior from first principles without free parameters, achieving χ²/N ≈ 1.04 across SPARC galaxies.

## Current Repository Contents

### Core Implementation
- `lnal_solver_core.py` — Simplified demonstration solver implementing Recognition Science gravity principles
- `requirements.txt` — Minimal dependencies (numpy, scipy, matplotlib)

### Key Documentation  
- `LNAL_Mathematical_Summary.txt` — Complete mathematical derivation from first principles
- `LNAL_Gravity_Nature_Paper.tex` — Formal academic manuscript
- `source_code.txt` — Full implementation reference and algorithm details

### Project Structure
- `.gitignore` — Excludes large binary outputs (plots, pickles, data files)

## Theory Overview

Recognition Science gravity emerges from:
1. **Golden ratio geometry** (φ = 1.618...) in curved spacetime
2. **Information field equations** with derived MOND emergence  
3. **Zero free parameters** — everything derived from axioms
4. **Recognition lengths** ℓ₁ = 0.97 kpc, ℓ₂ = 24.3 kpc

## Complete Implementation

The full project contains 100+ analysis scripts, complete SPARC galaxy data processing, hierarchical solvers, and validation plots. Due to file size constraints, the complete implementation remains in the local workspace. Key missing components:

- `lnal_prime_final_solver.py` — Complete field equation solver
- SPARC rotation curve data (`Rotmod_LTG/`, `*.mrt` files)
- Analysis results (`*.pkl`, `*.png` outputs)
- 50+ theoretical documents and peer-review drafts

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python lnal_solver_core.py
```
