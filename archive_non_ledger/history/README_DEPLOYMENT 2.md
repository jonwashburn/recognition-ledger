   - Test scripts and analysis tools

3. **Documentation** (54 text files)
   - Complete Recognition Science theory documentation
   - LNAL gravity derivations and first principles
   - Manuscript parts explaining the ledger-based physics
   - Analysis reports and summaries

4. **LaTeX Papers** (12 files)

   - Other theoretical papers

### What Was NOT Pushed (and why)

1. **Large Data Files** (`Rotmod_LTG/*.dat`)
   - 175 galaxy rotation curve data files
   - Should use Git LFS for these binary files

2. **Generated Images** (`*.png`, `*.pdf`)
   - Can be regenerated from the Python scripts
   - Keeps repository size manageable

3. **Nested Git Repositories**
   - `lnal-gravity/` - separate git repo
   - `recognition-ledger/` - Lean 4 formalization

### Key Implementation Notes

The PDE solvers implement the Recognition Science gravity equation:
```
(□ + X⁻²) Φ = 4π G∞ (λrec/r)^β ρ
```

Where:
- β = -(φ-1)/φ⁵ ≈ -0.0557 (from golden ratio φ)
- X = 3.57 × 10¹¹ m (information screening length)
- λrec = 2.42 × 10⁻¹² m (recognition wavelength)
- I* = 4.0 × 10¹⁸ J/m³ (information density scale)

### Numerical Challenges

All sophisticated solvers encountered numerical stability issues due to:
- Extreme scale separation (nm to kpc)
- High nonlinearity in the information field
- Large information density scale

The simpler approximation solvers (`lnal_advanced_solver_v2.py`) achieve better stability.

### Next Steps

1. **For Large Data Files**: Install Git LFS
   ```bash
   brew install git-lfs
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.dat"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add Rotmod_LTG/*.dat
   git commit -m "Add galaxy rotation data with Git LFS"
   git push
   ```

2. **For Nested Repos**: Consider git submodules or separate deployment

3. **For Better Numerical Stability**: 
   - Implement adaptive scaling strategies
   - Use dimensionless formulations
   - Consider spectral methods with better conditioning

The Recognition Science framework is now successfully version controlled and ready for collaboration!
