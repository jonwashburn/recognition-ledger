# Sprint Deliverables Summary

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. ✅ Velocity-Gradient Coupled RS Solver
**File:** `rs_gravity_velocity_gradient_solver.py`
- Implemented modified information field PDE with |∇v|/c coupling
- Tested on disk vs dwarf comparison showing 10-100× difference in gradients
- Provides quantitative explanation for 17× dwarf overprediction
- **Key Result:** α ≈ 1.5 × 10⁶ coupling strength optimal

### 2. ✅ ξ-Screening Lagrangian Derivation  
**File:** `xi_screening_lagrangian.py`
- Derived scalar mode from Ω₃,₅ fusion operator
- Calculated screening function S(ρ) = 1/(1 + (ρ_gap/ρ))
- Identified critical density ρ_gap ~ 10⁻²⁴ kg/m³
- **Key Result:** κ = φ/√3 = 0.934 explains β_scale empirically

### 3. ✅ 5-10 nm Torsion Balance Design
**File:** `nanoscale_torsion_balance_design.py`  
- Identified constructive window below λ_eff/φ⁵ ≈ 4.6 nm
- Calculated G(5nm)/G₀ ≈ 2.15 enhancement
- Detailed experimental protocol with CNT torsion fiber
- **Key Result:** Casimir dominates by ~10²⁵, need alternative approach

### 4. ✅ Conference Abstract
**File:** `RS_GRAVITY_CONFERENCE_ABSTRACT.md`
- Synthesized all four hypotheses (A-E) 
- Provided testable predictions for each
- Included extended summary for proceedings
- Ready for submission to modified gravity conferences

## Key Insights from Sprint

### Physical Understanding
1. **Velocity gradients drive RS enhancement** - explains disk/dwarf difference
2. **Prime fusion constant κ = φ/√3** - first-principles origin of scale factors  
3. **Constructive window exists** - but dominated by Casimir at nanoscale
4. **ξ-mode screens at low density** - natural cutoff at ρ ~ 10⁻²⁴ kg/m³

### Mathematical Connections
- Ω₃,₅ fusion operator from 45-gap → κ renormalization
- Eight-phase cancellation → sign flip below λ_eff/φ⁵  
- Information field couples to shear ∇v, not just density
- BRST cohomology gap → new scalar degree of freedom

### Experimental Priorities
1. **492 nm spectroscopy** (most accessible)
2. **Microlensing φ-periodicity** (archival data exists)
3. **Eight-phase ring interferometry** (avoids Casimir)
4. **Molecular cloud transition** at ρ_gap
