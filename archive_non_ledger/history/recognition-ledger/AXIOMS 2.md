# The Eight Recognition Axioms

<!-- DOCUMENT STRUCTURE NOTE:
This is the single source of truth for the axioms. Each axiom has:
1. Intuitive description (for humans)
2. Formal statement (for proofs)
3. Immediate consequences
4. Link to Lean formalization

## Overview

These eight axioms are the complete foundation of Recognition Science. They contain no free parameters and uniquely determine all physical constants.

---

## Axiom A1: Discrete Recognition

**Intuition**: Reality advances in discrete "ticks" like a cosmic clock. Between ticks, nothing changes.

**Formal Statement**:
```
There exists a countable, well-ordered set of instants called ticks such that:
- Physical state S is constant between consecutive ticks
- At tick t: S(t-) → S(t+) via injective map L
```

**Consequences**:
- Time is fundamentally discrete
- Continuous differential equations emerge as approximations
- Planck time emerges as τ₀ = 7.33 × 10⁻¹⁵ s

---

## Axiom A2: Dual-Recognition Balance  

**Intuition**: Every recognition event posts equal debits and credits. The universe maintains perfect double-entry bookkeeping.

**Formal Statement**:
```
There exists an involutive operator J where:
- J²(S) = S (applying twice returns original)
- L = J·L⁻¹·J (tick evolution respects duality)
- Σ(debits) + Σ(credits) = 0 always
```

**Consequences**:
- Conservation laws emerge from bookkeeping
- No net "debt" can exist in the universe
- Matter-antimatter balance

---

## Axiom A3: Positivity of Recognition Cost

**Intuition**: Every recognition event costs energy. You cannot have negative recognition.

**Formal Statement**:
```
There exists a cost functional C: States → ℝ≥0 where:
- C(S) = 0 iff S is vacuum
- ΔC ≥ 0 for all physical processes
- No state has C(S) < 0
```

**Consequences**:
- Arrow of time (cost only increases)
- Minimum energy quantum E_coh = 0.090 eV
- No perpetual motion machines

---

## Axiom A4: Unitary Ledger Evolution

**Intuition**: Information is never created or destroyed, only rearranged.

**Formal Statement**:
```
The tick operator L preserves inner products:
- ⟨L(S₁), L(S₂)⟩ = ⟨S₁, S₂⟩
- L† = L⁻¹ (unitary evolution)
```

**Consequences**:
- Quantum mechanics emerges
- Probability conservation
- Reversibility in principle

---

## Axiom A5: Irreducible Tick Interval

**Intuition**: There's a shortest possible time interval - you can't slice time infinitely thin.

**Formal Statement**:
```
There exists τ > 0 such that:
- Consecutive ticks: t_{n+1} - t_n = τ
- No events possible for t_n < t < t_{n+1}
```

**Consequences**:
- Planck relation E = hν emerges
- Quantized frequency spectrum
- Resolution of Zeno paradoxes

---

## Axiom A6: Irreducible Spatial Voxel

**Intuition**: Space comes in smallest possible cubes, like 3D pixels.

**Formal Statement**:
```
Space forms a cubic lattice L₀ℤ³ where:
- Fundamental length L₀ > 0
- State factorizes: S = ⊗_voxels S_x
- No structure below voxel scale
```

**Consequences**:
- Discrete space at Planck scale
- Integer-valued quantum numbers
- UV cutoff in field theory

---

## Axiom A7: Eight-Beat Closure

**Intuition**: The universe completes a full cycle every 8 ticks, like a cosmic octave.

**Formal Statement**:
```
The 8-fold tick operator satisfies:
- [L⁸, J] = 0 (commutes with duality)
- [L⁸, T_a] = 0 (commutes with translations)
```

**Consequences**:
- Gauge groups from residue mod 8
- Octet patterns in particle physics
- Musical harmony in nature

---

## Axiom A8: Self-Similarity of Recognition

**Intuition**: The universe uses the same pattern at every scale, zooming by golden ratio.

**Formal Statement**:
```
There exists a scale operator Σ where:
- C(Σ(S)) = λ·C(S) for some λ > 1
- [Σ, L] = 0 (commutes with time)
- [Σ, J] = 0 (preserves duality)
```

**Consequences**:
- λ must equal golden ratio φ = 1.618...
- Mass hierarchy E_n = E_coh × φⁿ
- Fractal structure of reality

- [`formal/axioms.lean`](formal/axioms.lean) - Axiom definitions
- [`formal/theorems.lean`](formal/theorems.lean) - Derived theorems
- [`formal/predictions.lean`](formal/predictions.lean) - Numerical predictions
