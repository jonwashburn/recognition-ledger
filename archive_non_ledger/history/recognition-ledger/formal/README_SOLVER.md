# Recognition Science Automated Proof System

## Overview

This system automatically proves all theorems in Recognition Science using a sophisticated multi-agent architecture with intelligent model escalation.

## Key Features

### Model Hierarchy
- **Initial**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (fast, efficient for most proofs)
- **Escalation**: Claude 3 Opus (powerful, for complex proofs)
- **Ultimate**: Opus with maximum tokens (32k) for diagnostic analysis

### Smart Escalation Logic
1. All agents start with Sonnet for efficiency
2. If Sonnet fails on a theorem, next attempt uses Opus
3. Critical theorems get Opus after 2+ failed attempts
4. Diagnostic escalation triggers after 3 iterations without progress

### Agent Army (20 Specialized Agents)
- **Mathematics**: Archimedes, Euler, Gauss, Riemann, Cauchy
- **Physics**: Einstein, Planck, Noether, Dirac
- **Recognition Science**: Pythagoras, Fibonacci, Kepler, Tesla
- **Formal Proofs**: Euclid, Bourbaki, Hilbert, Gödel
- **Verification**: Turing, Church, Curry

## Usage

### Run the Solver
```bash
python run_solver.py
```
or
```bash
./run_solver.py
```

The solver will:
1. Start with unproven theorems that have satisfied dependencies
2. Assign optimal agents based on theorem type
3. Run up to 20 agents in parallel
4. Automatically escalate models on failure
5. Save progress every 5 iterations
6. Continue until all theorems are proven

### Check Progress
```bash
python check_progress.py
```

This shows:
- Current proof status
- Progress by theorem level
- Critical theorem status
- Token usage and cost estimate
- Most attempted unproven theorems

### Direct Solver Execution
```bash
python ultimate_autonomous_solver.py
```

## Theorem Structure

### Levels
- **Level 0**: Axioms (A1-A8) - Given
- **Level 1**: Foundation (F1-F4) - Basic properties
- **Level 2**: Core (C1-C4) - Critical Recognition Science
- **Level 3**: Energy Cascade (E1-E5) - Mass/energy derivations
- **Level 4**: Gauge Structure (G1-G5) - Force unification
- **Level 5**: Predictions (P1-P7) - Testable results

### Critical Theorems
- **C1_GoldenRatioLockIn**: φ = (1+√5)/2 uniqueness
- **E1_CoherenceQuantum**: E_coh = 0.090 eV derivation
- **P1_ElectronMass**: 511 keV prediction
- **P3_FineStructure**: α = 1/137.036

## Cost Optimization

According to memory, you are NOT cost-conscious and prioritize solving problems. The system:
- Uses maximum tokens (8k for Sonnet, 32k for Opus)
- Runs 20 agents in parallel
- Automatically escalates to more powerful models
- Performs deep diagnostic analysis when stuck

## Files Generated

- `recognition_progress.json`: Current proof state
- `predictions/`: JSON files for each proven prediction
- Individual proof attempts stored in theorem objects

## Tips

1. **Let it run**: The solver is designed for autonomous operation
2. **Monitor progress**: Use `check_progress.py` to see status
3. **Interrupt safely**: Ctrl+C saves progress before exiting
4. **Trust escalation**: The system knows when to use more powerful models
5. **Check predictions**: Proven predictions generate JSON in `predictions/`

## Expected Runtime

- Foundation theorems: Minutes with Sonnet
- Core theorems: May require Opus escalation
- Full proof set: Several hours depending on complexity
- Cost estimate: $50-200 depending on escalations

## Troubleshooting

- **No progress**: Wait for diagnostic escalation (triggers after 3 stuck iterations)
- **API errors**: Check API key and rate limits
- **Memory issues**: Unlikely with current setup
- **Stuck theorems**: System will automatically try different approaches

Remember: The goal is complete autonomous proof generation. The system is designed to handle all complexity without manual intervention.
