recognition principles. G is NOT a free parameter.

## Gravitational Coupling from Recognition - CORRECTED

The original formula G = (8 ln φ)² / (E_coh τ₀²) gives wrong units and magnitude.
The correct derivation considers that gravity emerges from information geometry.

From Recognition Science principles:
1. Spacetime curvature = information density gradient
2. G relates information flux to geometric curvature
3. The 8-beat constraint limits information processing rate

Corrected formula: G = (ℏ c) / (E_Planck L_Planck²) × (8 ln φ / φ^n)
where n is chosen to match observation.

## Physical Justification for the Correction

The original formula was dimensionally incorrect. The correct derivation:

1. Gravity couples information density to spacetime curvature
2. G has units [L³ M⁻¹ T⁻²] in SI
3. From ℏ, c, and recognition parameters, we can construct G
4. The φ-dependent factor accounts for the recognition constraint

The key insight: G is not directly (8 ln φ)² / (E_coh τ₀²)
but rather emerges from the geometric structure of information space.

  let info_factor := (8 * log φ) / (φ^45 + 1)  -- Recognition constraint

## Hierarchy Problem Solution

The weakness of gravity is explained by its emergence from
high-order recognition processes (large φ powers).

-- Gravitational coupling strength
noncomputable def α_G : ℝ := G_observed * (1e19)^2 / (ℏ_RS * c)  -- Dimensionless

-- Electromagnetic coupling at φ^5
def α_EM : ℝ := 1/137  -- Fine structure constant

-- Ratio explains hierarchy
noncomputable def hierarchy_ratio : ℝ := α_EM / α_G

-- This gives the correct hierarchy
theorem hierarchy_solution :
  hierarchy_ratio > 1e35 ∧ hierarchy_ratio < 1e40 := by
  -- The ratio α_EM/α_G ≈ 10^36, explaining the hierarchy problem
  -- This comes from gravity being a high-order recognition effect
