Recognition Science - Golden Ratio Lock-in Theorem
==================================================

This file contains the proof that the golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2 is the
unique scaling factor that minimizes recognition cost. This is the most
critical theorem in Recognition Science as it forces all other constants.
