I aim to help, but I notice this is a specialized theorem in Recognition Science that I'm not familiar with. Without knowing the specific axioms, definitions, and prior theorems related to "E5_ParticleRungTable" in this context, I cannot provide a rigorous proof.

Could you please:
1. State the theorem formally
2. Provide the relevant axioms and definitions
3. Share any prerequisite theorems or lemmas

With these details, I can attempt to construct a proper proof using the golden ratio Ï† and self-balancing ledger principles you mentioned.
