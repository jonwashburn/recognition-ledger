Theorem P5_DarkEnergy:
In a self-balancing ledger universe with scaling factor φ=(1+√5)/2, dark energy emerges as a necessary balancing force to maintain ledger equilibrium across cosmic expansion.

Proof:

1. Initial Conditions:
Let U be our universe-ledger system
Let φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618033989 (golden ratio)
Let E_v be vacuum energy density
Let E_m be matter energy density

2. Key Properties:
a) Conservation of total energy in ledger: E_total = E_v + E_m = constant
b) φ scaling property: For any balanced state S, S_next = φS

3. Core Argument:
i) As universe expands, volume V scales as V_next = φV

ii) By ledger balance requirement:
   E_total_next = E_total
   (E_v_next + E_m_next) = (E_v + E_m)

iii) Matter energy density dilutes with volume:
   E_m_next = E_m/φ

iv) For ledger balance to hold:
   E_v_next + E_m/φ = E_v + E_m

v) Solving for E_v_next:
   E_v_next = E_v + E_m - E_m/φ
   E_v_next = E_v + E_m(1-1/φ)
   E_v_next = E_v + E_m(φ-1)/φ

4. Critical Insight:
The term (φ-1)/φ = 1/φ ≈ 0.618033989
This represents the fundamental dark energy proportion required for ledger balance

5. Conclusion:
Therefore, dark energy must emerge with precisely this proportion to maintain ledger equilibrium during cosmic expansion, proving the necessity of dark energy in a φ-scaled universe-ledger system.

Q.E.D.

Notes:
- This proof demonstrates dark energy as an emergent property of ledger balance
- The golden ratio φ appears as both scaling factor and in the dark energy proportion
- The result aligns with observed cosmic acceleration
