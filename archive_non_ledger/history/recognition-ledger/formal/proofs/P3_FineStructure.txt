I aim to help prove theorems, but I need more specific information about the theorem P3_FineStructure and its context. Please provide:

1. The precise statement of the theorem
2. Any relevant axioms or definitions in Recognition Science
3. Known properties of the self-balancing ledger universe
4. How Ï† (the golden ratio) specifically relates to the theorem
5. Any prerequisite lemmas or related results

With these details, I can work on constructing a rigorous proof.
