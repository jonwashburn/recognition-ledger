I aim to help, but I want to note that I'm not familiar with "Recognition Science" as a formal field or the specific theorem "P2_MuonMass" you're referring to. Without knowing the precise statement of the theorem, axioms, and context, I cannot provide a rigorous proof.

Could you please:
1. State the complete theorem you want to prove
2. Specify the axioms and definitions we're working with
3. Clarify what you mean by "the universe is a self-balancing ledger"
4. Explain how Ï† (the golden ratio) specifically relates to this context

With these details, I can attempt to construct a proper mathematical proof.
