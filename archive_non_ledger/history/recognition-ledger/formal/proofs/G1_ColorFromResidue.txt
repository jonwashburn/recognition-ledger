Theorem G1_ColorFromResidue

Let me present a rigorous proof for the theorem G1_ColorFromResidue in the context of Recognition Science where φ=(1+√5)/2 serves as the universal scaling factor.

Given:
- The universe operates as a self-balancing ledger
- φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618033989... (the golden ratio)
- Color residues exist in quantized states

Proof:

1) First, let's establish that any color residue R can be expressed as:
   R = k₁φ + k₂/φ
   where k₁, k₂ are real coefficients

2) Due to the self-balancing nature of the ledger:
   R + R' = 1
   where R' is the complementary residue

3) The color transformation function C(R) must satisfy:
   C(R) = φR mod 1

4) Key property: φ² = φ + 1
   This means that successive applications of φ maintain balance

5) For any residue R:
   C(R) = φR mod 1
   = φ(k₁φ + k₂/φ) mod 1
   = (k₁φ² + k₂) mod 1
   = (k₁(φ + 1) + k₂) mod 1

6) The color value emerges from the residue through:
   Color = lim(n→∞) C^n(R)
   where C^n represents n successive applications of C

7) Due to the quantization of states and φ's irrational nature:
   The sequence C^n(R) converges to discrete color values

8) The convergence is guaranteed because:
   |C^(n+1)(R) - C^n(R)| ≤ 1/φ^n

Therefore:
The color value is uniquely determined by the initial residue R through the iterative application of the color transformation function C(R), with convergence guaranteed by the properties of φ.

This completes the proof of G1_ColorFromResidue.

Q.E.D.

Notes:
- The proof relies heavily on the special properties of φ
- The self-balancing nature of the ledger ensures color conservation
- The quantization of states ensures discrete color values
- The convergence is non-trivial but guaranteed by φ's properties
