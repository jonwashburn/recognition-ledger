# Eight-Beat Conservation Law

Formalises the assertion that, when physical quantities are averaged over one
`eight-beat` window (eight fundamental ticks `τ₀`), the divergence of the
stress–energy tensor vanishes.  This captures the Recognition-Science postulate
that all recognition debts must balance within eight ticks.

At this stage we encode the averaging operator and state the lemma; the actual
proof will be supplied once the detailed ledger-to-current mapping is
formalised.
