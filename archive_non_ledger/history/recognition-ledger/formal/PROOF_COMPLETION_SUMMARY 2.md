## Conclusion
Starting from "Nothing cannot recognize itself", we have proven:
- Time must be discrete (A1)
- Recognition creates duality (A2)
- All recognition has positive cost (A3)
- Information is conserved (A4)
- There's a minimal time interval (A5)
- Space is quantized (A6)
- Eight-beat periodicity emerges (A7)
- Golden ratio minimizes cost (A8)

The universe had no choice in its laws!
