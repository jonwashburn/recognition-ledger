LNAL Parameter-Free Model Progress Summary
==========================================

Task D Complete: Recognition-Based Lambda Modulation
---------------------------------------------------

Implemented recognition-scale modulation of Λ(r) using:
- ℓ₁ = 0.97 kpc (first recognition length)  
- ℓ₂ = 24.3 kpc (second recognition length)

Modulation function:
- r < ℓ₁: mod = (r/ℓ₁)^φ (strong suppression)
- ℓ₁ < r < ℓ₂: mod = t^(1/φ) where t = (r-ℓ₁)/(ℓ₂-ℓ₁)
- r > ℓ₂: mod = 1.0 (full MOND)

Result: Minimal improvement from base model

Overall Model Status (Zero Free Parameters)
------------------------------------------

Current formula: V²(r) = GM/r × Ξ × Ψ × Λ(r) × P

1. Ξ(f_gas) = 1/(1 - f_gas × φ^(-2))
   - Baryon completeness from golden ratio

2. Ψ(M*) = 1 + N × (φ^(1/8) - 1)  
   - Information debt with Schwarzschild cutoff
   - N = min(log_φ(M*/M₀), log_φ(R_s/L₀))

3. Λ(r) = μ + (1-μ) × mod × √(g†r/GM_eff)
   - MOND interpolation with recognition modulation
   - μ(x) = x/√(1+x²), x = a/g†

4. P = φ^(-1/2) × 8/π² = 0.637
   - Prime sieve odd square-free density

5. H₂/HI = (M*/10^10.5)^(0.3×√φ/2)
   - Metallicity-based molecular gas

Performance Metrics
------------------
- Median V_model/V_obs = 1.152
- Mean ratio = 1.212 ± 0.614
- Success rate (0.8-1.2): 36.3%

Strong correlations remain:
- Gas fraction: r = -0.623 (p < 10^-15)
- Stellar mass: r = 0.582 (p < 10^-13)

Morphology dependence:
- Early types (S0-Sb): 1.232 ± 0.367
- Intermediate (Sbc-Sd): 1.404 ± 0.461  
- Late types (Sdm-Im): 0.928 ± 0.336

Next Steps for Improvement
-------------------------
The Lambda refinement showed recognition scales need more sophisticated treatment. 
Strong gas/mass correlations suggest environmental effects are key.

Remaining parameter-free enhancements:
1. Environmental recognition (tidal radius from cluster potential)
2. Bar/spiral pattern speeds from stability criteria
3. Velocity dispersion anisotropy from virial equilibrium
4. Multi-scale recognition harmonics

All derived from Recognition Science axioms without introducing free parameters.
