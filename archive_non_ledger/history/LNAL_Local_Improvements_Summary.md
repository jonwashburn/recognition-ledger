# LNAL Local Improvements Summary

## Overview
We implemented all locally feasible improvements to test LNAL gravity theory against galaxy rotation curves. Despite sophisticated approaches, all methods yielded poor fits (χ²/N >> 1), suggesting fundamental issues beyond implementation details.

## Approaches Implemented

### 1. Component Decomposition from SPARC Data
- **File**: `lnal_component_analyzer.py`
- **Method**: Used SPARC's V_gas, V_disk, V_bulge decomposition to infer surface densities
- **Results**: 
  - Mean χ²/N: 13,687
  - Range: 2,886 - 42,630
- **Issues**: Direct inversion of velocity components is numerically unstable

### 2. Forward Modeling with Observational Effects
- **File**: `lnal_forward_model_v2.py`
- **Method**: Included beam smearing, inclination projection, vertical structure
- **Results**:
  - Mean χ²/N: 7,900
  - Range: 1,512 - 25,959
- **Note**: Slightly better but still very poor fits

### 3. Hierarchical Bayesian Model (Attempted)
- **File**: `lnal_hierarchical_bayes.py`
- **Method**: Learn population-level parameters across galaxies
- **Status**: Failed due to initial conditions issue
- **Potential**: Could constrain systematic biases if properly implemented

### 4. Machine Learning Baryon Emulator
- **File**: `lnal_ml_baryon_emulator.py`
- **Method**: Gaussian Process to predict surface density from observables
- **Results**:
  - Mean χ²/N: 17,493
  - Range: 722 - 42,617
- **Issue**: ML can't overcome fundamental mismatch

### 5. Full 3D Poisson Solver
- **File**: `lnal_3d_poisson_solver.py`
- **Method**: Miyamoto-Nagai thick disks + Hernquist bulges with LNAL
- **Results**:
  - Mean χ²/N: 13,532
  - Range: 2,752 - 42,591
- **Note**: Most physically realistic approach, still fails

## Key Findings

### 1. Consistent Failure Pattern
All approaches yield χ²/N values 100-1000x larger than acceptable (χ²/N ~ 1), indicating systematic rather than random errors.

### 2. DDO154 Particularly Problematic
Dwarf galaxies consistently show worst fits (χ²/N > 40,000), suggesting LNAL struggles with low-acceleration systems where MOND effects should dominate.

### 3. No Dark Matter Required
None of the fits improved by adding dark matter components, confirming LNAL attempts to explain rotation curves with baryons alone.

### 4. Observational Effects Minor
Forward modeling with realistic observational effects (beam smearing, inclination) provided only marginal improvements.

## Technical Insights

### Surface Density Inference Issues
- Direct inversion V → Σ is ill-conditioned
- Small velocity errors → large surface density errors
- Need regularization or prior information

### Model Complexity vs. Data Quality
- SPARC data has ~5-10% velocity uncertainties
- Models require ~1% precision to distinguish theories
- Systematic errors dominate over statistical

### Baryon Distribution Uncertainty
- Gas distribution poorly constrained (HI only, no H₂)
- Stellar M/L ratios uncertain
- Disk thickness assumptions critical

## Recommendations for Further Work

### 1. Theory Refinement
- Check LNAL formula derivation
- Verify G† = 1.2×10⁻¹⁰ m/s² is correct
- Consider additional physics (tides, environment)

### 2. Better Data
- Need molecular gas (CO) observations
- Require full 2D velocity fields (not just major axis)
- Multi-wavelength stellar mass estimates

### 3. Alternative Approaches
- Test on globular clusters (cleaner systems)
- Solar system constraints
- Cosmological simulations with LNAL

### 4. Hybrid Models
- LNAL + small dark matter component
- LNAL with varying G†(environment)
- Modified LNAL interpolation function

## Conclusion

Despite implementing sophisticated analysis techniques, LNAL gravity (as currently formulated) cannot adequately fit galaxy rotation curves. The consistent factor of ~1000 discrepancy suggests either:

1. The theory needs fundamental revision
2. We're missing crucial baryonic components
3. Dark matter is real and necessary

The "tune the galaxy, not the law" philosophy is correct in principle but insufficient in practice given current observational constraints.
