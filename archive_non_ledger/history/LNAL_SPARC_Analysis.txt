LNAL GRAVITY vs SPARC GALAXY ROTATION CURVES
=============================================

IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE
-------------------
The LNAL running-G formula: G(r) = G₀(1 + α_G L₀²/r² e^(-r/L₀))
At galactic scales (r ~ kpc ~ 10¹⁹ m >> L₀ = 0.335 nm):
- e^(-r/L₀) ≈ e^(-10²⁸) ≈ 0
- Therefore G(r) ≈ G₀ (no modification)

This means the voxel-scale running of G provides NO help explaining flat rotation curves!

POTENTIAL SOLUTION: INFORMATION GRADIENTS
-----------------------------------------
The paper proposes dark matter emerges from information gradients:
ρ_DM(x) = (c²/8πG) |∇I_cosmic(x)|²/I_cosmic(x)

For this to explain SPARC data, we need:

1. **Information Distribution Model**
   Assume galactic information follows baryonic matter with modification:
   I_galaxy(r) = I_baryon(r) × F(r)
   
   Where F(r) is an "information amplification factor" arising from:
   - Pattern complexity of stellar/gas dynamics
   - Quantum coherence maintenance costs
   - Gravitational binding energy encoding

2. **Predicted Rotation Curve**
   The total mass would be:
   M_total(r) = M_baryon(r) + M_info(r)
   
   Where M_info comes from integrating ρ_DM from information gradients.

3. **Key Prediction**
   Since information gradients depend on PATTERN COMPLEXITY, LNAL predicts:
   - More structured galaxies (spirals) need more "dark matter"
   - Smooth ellipticals need less
   - Irregular/disturbed galaxies show deviations

TESTABLE PREDICTIONS FOR SPARC
------------------------------
1. **Morphology Dependence**: Plot residuals vs galaxy type
   - Spirals should show tightest fit
   - Ellipticals more scatter
   - Irregulars most scatter

2. **Information Entropy Correlation**
   Define: S_morph = morphological entropy (from image analysis)
   Prediction: M_DM/M_baryon ∝ S_morph

3. **Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR)**
   McGaugh found: g_obs = g_bar/[1 - exp(-√(g_bar/g†))]
   
   LNAL interpretation: The scale g† = 1.2×10⁻¹⁰ m/s² corresponds to
   where information gradient effects become significant.

CALCULATION NEEDED
------------------
To properly test against SPARC, we need to:

1. Derive F(r) from first principles using:
   - Stellar density profiles
   - Gas distribution
   - Pattern maintenance costs

2. Compute ρ_DM(r) for each galaxy

3. Generate rotation curves and compare to data

4. Look for systematic deviations based on galaxy properties

PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT
----------------------
Without the full calculation, LNAL faces challenges:
- No natural explanation for universal g† scale
- Information gradients need fine-tuning to match observations
- Prediction of morphology-dependence is testable but risky

The theory would need development of a specific galactic information model before meaningful SPARC comparison.
