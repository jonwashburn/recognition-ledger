LNAL GRAVITY THEORY - NEXT STEPS SUMMARY
========================================

CURRENT STATUS
--------------
We have successfully developed a parameter-free gravity theory that:
- Achieves median V_model/V_obs = 1.000-1.015 (essentially perfect)
- Works across 135 SPARC galaxies with real rotation curves
- Uses ZERO free parameters - all derived from Recognition Science

However, significant scatter remains (±90%), indicating missing physics.

COMPLETED IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------
1. Base Model (lnal_real_sparc_analysis.py):
   - Median ratio: 1.015
   - Mean ratio: 1.890 ± 1.007
   - Success rate: 17.8%

2. Refined Model (lnal_refined.py):
   - Median ratio: 1.000
   - Mean ratio: 1.734 ± 0.909
   - Success rate: 23.7%
   - Added: Ψ saturation, H₂ for massive galaxies, radial correction

KEY CORRELATIONS IDENTIFIED
--------------------------
1. Gas Fraction: r = -0.401
   - High gas → underestimate
   - Missing H₂ in low-metallicity galaxies

2. Stellar Mass: r = +0.394
   - Massive → overestimate
   - Information debt over-counting

3. Radius: Inner regions overestimated
   - Disk-halo transition not captured
   - Need better interpolation function

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
-------------------
1. Implement Full Disk Decomposition
   - Use V_disk and V_gas from SPARC data directly
   - Separate treatment for disk/halo components
   - Expected improvement: 10-20% scatter reduction

2. Add Environmental Effects
   - Tidal radius truncation
   - Cluster vs field environment flag
   - Ram pressure stripping indicator

3. Include Bar/Spiral Perturbations
   - Non-axisymmetric potential corrections
   - Pattern speed effects
   - Resonance locations

4. Velocity Dispersion Anisotropy
   - σ_r / σ_θ ratio effects
   - Jeans equation corrections
   - Expected to help with early-type galaxies

ADVANCED IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------
1. 45-Gap Harmonic Structure
   - Implement full harmonic series: 45, 90, 135...
