RS GRAVITY V5 PREDICTION ERROR ANALYSIS
==================================================

Total failed predictions: 7
Average error: 11.7σ
Worst prediction: pulsar_timing_deviation

IDENTIFIED PROBLEM AREAS:
------------------------------

DWARF_SPHEROIDALS:
  Issue: Velocity dispersions underpredicted by ~35%
  Affects: draco, fornax, sculptor
  Likely cause: ξ-mode screening too strong or missing physics
  Suggested fix: Revisit screening function or add baryonic feedback

RELATIVISTIC_EFFECTS:
  Issue: No detection of predicted deviations from GR
  Affects: pulsar_timing, strong_lensing
  Likely cause: Effects too small or wrong functional form
  Suggested fix: Reduce predicted amplitudes or add relativistic corrections

FIT_QUALITY:
  Issue: High χ²/N even for best fits
  Affects: sparc_median, good_fits_fraction
  Likely cause: Missing small-scale physics or oversimplified model
  Suggested fix: Add gas pressure, non-circular motions, or feedback


SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS (by priority):
------------------------------

1. ξ-mode screening
   Current: S(ρ) = 1/(1 + ρ_gap/ρ)
   Suggested: S(ρ) = 1/(1 + (ρ_gap/ρ)^α) with α ~ 0.5
   Rationale: Softer transition better matches dwarf data

2. Baryonic physics
   Current: Pure gravitational model
   Suggested: Add pressure support term: ∇P/ρ
   Rationale: Gas pressure significant in low-mass galaxies

3. Amplitude scaling
   Current: β₀ = -0.0557
   Suggested: β_eff = β₀ × (1 - v²/c²)
   Rationale: Relativistic suppression at high velocities

4. Velocity gradient coupling
   Current: α_grad = 1.5e6 m (fixed)
   Suggested: α_grad(ρ) = α₀/(1 + ρ/ρ_crit)
   Rationale: Density-dependent coupling improves dwarf fits
