PEER REVIEW REPORT
Title: Gravity as Cosmic Ledger Balancing – From Information Debt to Spacetime Curvature
Author: Jonathan Washburn
Reviewer: Anonymous
Date: \today

SUMMARY
The manuscript proposes that gravity arises from information-processing constraints encoded in a Light-Native Assembly Language (LNAL). It extends earlier ledger-gravity ideas with a voxel-based processing architecture, derives Einstein's equations from four axioms, predicts a running Newton constant at nanometer scales, and offers far-reaching cosmological and technological implications.

STRENGTHS
1. Ambitious unification of gravity, information theory, and computation.
2. Clear axiomatic structure leading to Einstein equations.
3. Concrete experimental proposals (torsion balance, atom interferometry).
4. Quantitative cosmological estimates that match observed dark-matter and dark-energy densities.
5. Bold technological roadmap stimulating interdisciplinary discussion.

MAJOR CONCERNS
1. **Signal-to-Noise Mismatch**
   • Table 1 quotes ∆F ≈ 1.7×10⁻³⁵ N at 1 nm, yet thermal noise is 2×10⁻¹⁶ N √Hz – twelve orders of magnitude larger.  The claimed SNR ≈ 5 appears mis-computed (should be ~10⁻¹⁹).  Re-evaluate feasibility or propose noise-reduction strategies.

2. **Casimir & van der Waals Subtraction**
   • Casimir force at 1 nm is >10²³ times larger than the predicted gravitational enhancement.  The manuscript must detail differential-modulation or material-change techniques that cancel Casimir/vdW to ≤10⁻²⁴ precision – currently absent.

3. **Atom-Interferometer Geometry**
   • A 1-kg lead cube positioned 1–10 nm from an atomic cloud is physically impossible: gravity test mass cannot approach within nanometers without destroying the trap.  Consider using nanofabricated masses (<10⁻¹⁵ kg) inside hollow-core fibres or on atom chips.

4. **Composite Graviton Section**
   • The BRAID definition (Eq. 24) ignores gauge constraints and photon indistinguishability.  Provide an explicit symmetrised two-photon wave-function and show how the quadrupole radiation pattern emerges.

5. **Cosmological Section**
   • Dark-energy density derivation uses τ₀→0 approximation after earlier setting τ₀ = 7.33 fs.  Clarify limiting procedure or keep τ₀ finite.

6. **Technological Applications**
   • Claims of propellantless propulsion and consciousness transfer are highly speculative.  Recommend moving to an Outlook subsection flagged as conjectural.

MINOR ISSUES
• Equation numbering restarts in each section – adopt a global counter.
• Use \mu m not μm in math mode for consistency.
• Define all symbols on first use (e.g., k in atom-interferometer phase formula).
• Figure captions are missing; insert schematic diagrams of experimental setups.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REVISION
A. Re-compute all force estimates with full numerical detail; include a sensitivity table.
B. Provide a realistic Casimir-background cancellation protocol.
C. Replace 1-kg test mass with on-chip nanomasses; update phase-shift estimates.
D. Expand composite-graviton derivation with group-theory language (SU(2) helicity basis).
E. Move speculative devices to an appendix; tighten abstract to <200 words.
F. Add comparison with entropic-gravity and emergent-space models in Discussion.

CONCLUSION
The paper is visionary and potentially groundbreaking but requires substantial quantitative correction and clearer separation of established results from speculation.  Addressing the experimental feasibility issues is paramount for acceptance in a top-tier journal.
