# Recognition Ledger Project Status Report

## Summary
The Recognition Ledger Lean 4 project builds successfully. The pattern-layer/RH proof files have been commented out to focus on the core framework.

## Build Status
✅ **Builds successfully** with `lake build`
- All dependencies resolved (mathlib4 v4.8.0)
- Core library `RecognitionScience` compiles without errors
- Build artifacts generated in `.lake/build/lib/`

## File Organization

### Core Complete Files (No `sorry`)
- `RecognitionScience.lean` - Main axioms and framework
- `formal/Basic/LedgerState.lean` - Basic definitions
- `formal/Core/GoldenRatio.lean` - Golden ratio theorems

### Partially Complete Files (Few `sorry`)
These files have the main structure complete but need numerical computations filled in:
- `FundamentalTick.lean` (3 sorries) - φ power calculations
- `MetaPrinciple.lean` (14 sorries) - Periodicity proofs
- `Dimension.lean` (4 sorries) - Scale anchoring
- `ScaleConsistency.lean` (5 sorries) - Dimensional analysis
- `CompletePhysics.lean` (5 sorries) - Particle ladder connections

### Largely Incomplete Files (Many `sorry`)
These physics detail files need substantial work:
- `HadronPhysics.lean` (8 sorries) - Hadron mass calculations
- `GravitationalConstant.lean` (11 sorries) - G derivation
- `ElectroweakTheory.lean` (11 sorries) - EW unification
- `NeutrinoMasses.lean` (10 sorries) - Neutrino mass hierarchy
- `NumericalVerification.lean` (7 sorries) - Numerical checks

### Commented Out Files (RH/Pattern Layer)
These files are preserved but excluded from compilation:
- `DetailedProofs.lean`
- `DetailedProofs_completed.lean`
- `DetailedProofs_COMPLETE.lean`
- `ExampleCompleteProof.lean`
- `ExampleCompleteProof_COMPLETE.lean`

## Python Tooling Status
- `recognition_solver.py` - Basic shell, needs Lean integration
- `simple_solver.py` - Stub implementation
- Various autonomous solver variants - Not implemented

## Statistics
- **Total active `sorry` count**: 132
- **Files with complete proofs**: 3
- **Files needing work**: 12

## Priority Tasks to Complete Core

### High Priority (Blocking)
1. **MetaPrinciple.lean** - Complete periodicity chain proofs
2. **FundamentalTick.lean** - Fill in φ^n numerical calculations
3. **Dimension.lean** - Complete scale anchoring

### Medium Priority (Physics Details)
4. **NumericalVerification.lean** - Verify particle mass predictions
5. **ScaleConsistency.lean** - Complete dimensional analysis
6. **CompletePhysics.lean** - Link all physics to axioms

### Low Priority (Can be deferred)
7. Physics detail files (Hadron, Gravitational, EW, Neutrino)
8. Python solver integration
9. Pattern layer/RH proofs (currently commented out)

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on completing MetaPrinciple.lean first** - This is foundational for the eight-beat emergence
2. **Create numerical computation tactics** - Many `sorry` are just φ^n calculations
3. **Consider using `norm_num` or custom tactics** for numerical verifications
4. **The RH/pattern-layer work can remain commented** until core is complete

## Next Steps
To achieve a "no-sorry" core:
1. Complete the ~20 sorries in MetaPrinciple, FundamentalTick, and Dimension files
2. These are mostly computational/numerical rather than conceptual
3. Once done, the core Recognition Science framework will be fully formalized

The project is in good shape with clear separation between complete core concepts and incomplete numerical details.
