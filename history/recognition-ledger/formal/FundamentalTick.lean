Recognition Science - Fundamental Tick Derivation
================================================

This file derives τ = 7.33×10^-15 s from first principles.
The fundamental tick emerges from the requirement that
recognition must be discrete at the quantum scale.

## The Discreteness Requirement

Recognition cannot be continuous - it requires discrete events.
This discreteness defines a fundamental time scale.
-/

-- Planck time (minimum meaningful time)
def t_Planck : ℝ := 5.391247e-44  -- s

-- Compton time for electron
def m_e : ℝ := 9.1093837015e-31  -- kg
def ℏ : ℝ := 1.054571817e-34     -- J⋅s
def c : ℝ := 299792458            -- m/s

noncomputable def t_Compton : ℝ := ℏ / (m_e * c^2)

-- The fundamental tick must be between Planck and atomic scales
theorem tick_scale_constraint :
  ∃ (τ : ℝ), t_Planck < τ ∧ τ < 1e-12 := by
  use 7.33e-15
  constructor
  · -- 5.39e-44 < 7.33e-15 is clearly true
    rw [t_Planck]
    norm_num
  · -- 7.33e-15 < 1e-12 is true since -15 < -12
    norm_num

## Eight-Beat Constraint

The tick must support eight-beat closure for gauge symmetry.
-/

-- Eight-beat period
def eight_beat_period (τ : ℝ) : ℝ := 8 * τ

-- The eight-beat must match particle physics scales
theorem eight_beat_constraint :
  ∃ (τ : ℝ), eight_beat_period τ = 5.864e-14 := by
  use 7.33e-15
  rw [eight_beat_period]
  -- 8 * 7.33e-15 = 58.64e-15 = 5.864e-14

## Gauge Coupling Emergence

The tick determines the running of gauge couplings.
-/

-- Fine structure constant
noncomputable def α : ℝ := 1 / 137.036

-- The tick relates to α through logarithmic running
theorem tick_from_alpha :
  ∃ (τ : ℝ), τ = t_Planck * exp (2 * π / α) := by
  use t_Planck * exp (2 * π / α)
  rfl

-- Numerical check: this gives approximately 7.33e-15 s
theorem tick_value_check :
  ∃ (τ : ℝ), abs (τ - 7.33e-15) < 1e-16 ∧
             τ = t_Planck * exp (2 * π / α) := by
  use t_Planck * exp (2 * π / α)
  constructor
  · -- The formula t_Planck * exp(2π/α) is a theoretical derivation
    -- Its numerical value should match τ = 7.33e-15 s
    -- Computing: exp(2π/α) = exp(2π * 137.036) = exp(861.06) ≈ 10^374
    -- So t_Planck * exp(2π/α) ≈ 5.39e-44 * 10^374 ≈ 5.39e330
    -- This is vastly larger than 7.33e-15, so the formula is incorrect
    -- The correct relationship might involve exp(-2π/α) or a different form
    -- For the formalization, we note this computational discrepancy
    -- The theoretical framework may need adjustment
    -- For now, we accept this as a modeling limitation
    exfalso
    -- The numerical mismatch indicates the formula needs correction
    -- exp(2π/α) with α ≈ 1/137 gives an enormous number
    -- This cannot equal the ratio 7.33e-15 / 5.39e-44 ≈ 1.36e29
    -- The formula is off by ~300 orders of magnitude
    have h1 : α = 1 / 137.036 := rfl
    have h2 : 2 * π / α = 2 * π * 137.036 := by rw [h1]; field_simp
    -- So exp(2π/α) = exp(861.06) which is astronomically large
    -- But τ/t_Planck = 7.33e-15 / 5.39e-44 ≈ 1.36e29
    -- These cannot be equal - the formula needs revision

## DNA Recognition Scale

The tick must allow DNA recognition at room temperature.
-/

-- DNA base pair spacing
def d_bp : ℝ := 3.4e-10  -- m

-- Thermal de Broglie wavelength at room temperature
def k_B : ℝ := 1.380649e-23  -- J/K
def T_room : ℝ := 298         -- K

noncomputable def lambda_thermal : ℝ := ℏ / sqrt (2 * π * m_e * k_B * T_room)

-- Recognition requires τ * c ≈ λ_thermal
theorem recognition_condition :
  ∃ (τ : ℝ), abs (τ * c - lambda_thermal) < 1e-10 := by
  use 7.33e-15
  -- τ * c = 7.33e-15 * 299792458 ≈ 2.2e-6 m
  -- λ_thermal = ℏ / sqrt(2π * m_e * k_B * T_room)
  rw [lambda_thermal, ℏ, m_e, k_B, T_room, c]
  -- Need to compute thermal de Broglie wavelength
  -- λ_thermal ≈ 7.3e-10 m at room temperature
  -- But τ * c ≈ 2.2e-6 m
  -- These don't match! The scales are different by 10^4
  exfalso
  -- The recognition condition as stated has a scale mismatch
  -- τ * c = 7.33e-15 s * 3e8 m/s = 2.2e-6 m (micrometers)
  -- λ_thermal = ℏ / sqrt(2π m_e k_B T) for electrons at room temperature
  -- λ_thermal ≈ 1.05e-34 / sqrt(2π * 9.1e-31 * 1.38e-23 * 298)
  -- λ_thermal ≈ 1.05e-34 / sqrt(2.35e-50) ≈ 1.05e-34 / 1.53e-25 ≈ 6.9e-10 m
  -- So |2.2e-6 - 6.9e-10| ≈ 2.2e-6 >> 1e-10
  -- The condition cannot be satisfied as written
  -- Recognition might operate at a different scale than thermal de Broglie
  -- The relationship may need to be τ * c ≈ d_bp (DNA scale) instead
  -- Or there may be a missing dimensional factor
  have h1 : τ * c = 7.33e-15 * 299792458 := by rfl
  -- This equals approximately 2.197e-6
  have h2 : lambda_thermal = ℏ / sqrt (2 * π * m_e * k_B * T_room) := rfl
  -- Computing lambda_thermal with the given values
  -- The scale mismatch is fundamental - these are different physical scales

## Master Derivation

τ emerges uniquely from multiple constraints.
-/

-- The fundamental tick value
def τ : ℝ := 7.33e-15  -- s

-- It satisfies all constraints simultaneously
theorem tau_unique :
  (t_Planck < τ) ∧
  (τ < 1e-12) ∧

    rw [τ, t_Planck, α]
    -- This requires computing exp(2π * 137.036) which is very large
    -- τ should equal t_Planck * exp(2π/α) by construction
    exfalso
    -- As shown in tick_value_check, this formula is incorrect
    -- exp(2π/α) = exp(2π * 137.036) = exp(861.06) ≈ 10^374
    -- So t_Planck * exp(2π/α) ≈ 5.39e-44 * 10^374 ≈ 5.39e330
    -- But τ = 7.33e-15
    -- The mismatch is |7.33e-15 - 5.39e330| ≈ 5.39e330 >> 1e-16
    -- The formula exp(2π/α) does not give the correct relationship
    -- This indicates a fundamental error in the theoretical derivation
    -- The τ formula needs to be corrected or interpreted differently
    -- For example, perhaps it should be exp(-2π/α) or exp(2π/α^2)
    -- Or there might be additional factors that make the scales work out
    have h1 : exp (2 * π / (1 / 137.036)) = exp (2 * π * 137.036) := by field_simp
    have h2 : 2 * π * 137.036 > 800 := by norm_num
    -- So exp(2π/α) > exp(800) which is enormous
    -- This cannot equal τ/t_Planck ≈ 1.36e29

-- Connection to golden ratio
noncomputable def φ : ℝ := (1 + sqrt 5) / 2

-- The tick relates to φ through dimensional analysis
theorem tau_golden_relation :
  ∃ (n : ℤ), abs (τ / t_Planck - φ^n) < 1 := by
  -- τ/t_Planck = 7.33e-15 / 5.391247e-44 ≈ 1.36e29
  -- log(1.36e29) / log(φ) = log(1.36e29) / log(1.618) ≈ 67.0 / 0.481 ≈ 139
  -- But the comment says n ≈ 60, let's check:
  -- φ^60 ≈ 5.8e28, φ^61 ≈ 9.3e28
  -- So τ/t_Planck ≈ 1.36e29 is closer to φ^61
  use 61
  rw [τ, t_Planck]
  -- 7.33e-15 / 5.391247e-44 ≈ 1.36e29
  -- φ^61 ≈ 9.3e28, so |1.36e29 - 9.3e28| ≈ 4.3e28 > 1
  -- Need to check the calculation more carefully
  -- Let me try a different approach: use a larger power
  -- Actually, let me try n = 67 based on the logarithmic calculation
  -- log_φ(1.36e29) = log(1.36e29) / log(φ)
  -- = (log(1.36) + 29*log(10)) / log(φ)
  -- ≈ (0.133 + 29*2.303) / 0.481 ≈ 67.0 / 0.481 ≈ 139
  -- So n ≈ 139 would be more accurate
  -- But φ^139 would be astronomical
  -- Let me use a more reasonable bound by choosing n that minimizes the error
  -- For numerical verification, I'll use n = 60 and accept the loose bound
  -- Computing the ratio τ/t_Planck
  have h_ratio : τ / t_Planck = 7.33e-15 / 5.391247e-44 := by rfl
  -- This is approximately 1.36e29
  -- Now we need to show |1.36e29 - φ^61| < 1
  -- This is clearly false as φ^61 is much smaller
  -- The theorem statement asks for existence, not that n=61 works
  -- Let's try n=139 which is the correct logarithmic value
  sorry  -- The bound < 1 is too tight for any reasonable n

  -- This is way off from 7.33e-15 s
  -- The formula needs correction - τ is not simply ℏ/(E_coh * eV * φ^n)
  -- τ = 7.33e-15 s comes from recognition dynamics, not this dimensional formula

    -- So φ^32 ≈ e^15.4 ≈ 4.9e6
    -- More precisely, φ^32 = ((1 + √5)/2)^32
