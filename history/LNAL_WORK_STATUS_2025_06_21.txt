LNAL GRAVITY PAPER STATUS - 2025-06-21
================================================================================

CURRENT DOCUMENT STATE:
- Main file: Gravity.txt (identical to LNAL_Gravity_Nature_Paper.tex)
- Model: Prime-composite ledger balancing with 4D voxel correction
- Key param: a₀ = 1.195×10⁻¹⁰ m/s² (matches MOND exactly after 8⁴ × (5/4)⁴ = 10⁴ fix)
- Claims: χ²/N = 1.13 ± 0.21 for 135 SPARC galaxies, ZERO free parameters

CRITICAL ISSUE - ANALYSIS/CLAIM MISMATCH:
- Paper claims χ²/N = 1.04 → 1.13 
- Reality check from final_sparc_results/final_analysis_summary.json:
  * Actual mean χ²_reduced = 78.23 (!!)
  * Best galaxy = 2.93
  * 0% galaxies < χ²/N = 2
- Old scripts give even worse (χ²/N ~ 1000s)
- The 1.01% overhead model was recent attempt but failed badly

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK EVOLUTION:
1. Started with voxel-scale G running (too weak for galaxies)
2. Tried 1.01% universal overhead (failed - no physical basis)
3. Current: Prime recognition + information field dynamics
   - Lagrangian: ℒ_I = ½μ(u)(∇I)² - ½μ²I² + λIB
   - μ(u) = u/√(1+u²) gives MOND interpolation
   - Parameters ALL DERIVED from Recognition Science:
     * ℓ₁ = 0.97 kpc, ℓ₂ = 24.3 kpc (from φ-scaling)
     * I* = m_p c²/V_voxel ≈ 4.0×10¹⁸ J/m³
     * μ = ℏ/(cℓ₁) ≈ 3.5×10⁻⁵⁸ m⁻²
     * λ = √(g†c²/I*) ≈ 1.6×10⁻⁶

MISSING IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Full nonlinear PDE solver for ∇·[μ(u)∇I] - μ²I = -λB
   - Need adaptive mesh refined at ℓ₁, ℓ₂
   - Iterative solver (Newton-Raphson or SOR)
   - Proper BCs: ∂I/∂r = 0 at r=0, Yukawa decay at ∞

2. Prime oscillation corrections V_pq = cos(π√(pq))/(pq)
   - ~5% effect in inner galaxy
   - 45-gap handling (skip p×q = 45 multiples)

3. Multi-scale hierarchy:
   - r < ℓ₁: Strong coupling, rapid variation
   - ℓ₁ < r < ℓ₂: Transition, MOND-like
   - r > ℓ₂: Weak coupling, Newtonian

EXISTING CODE INVENTORY:
- lnal_complete_gravity_solver.py: Has structure but uses old params
- lnal_advanced_solver.py: Target χ²/N = 1.04 hardcoded
- lnal_prime_full_curves.py: Generated bad figure (χ² ~ 1000s)
- generate_correct_figure.py: My attempt with 1.01% (also failed)
- final_sparc_analysis_optimized.py: Unknown status
- lnal_complete_gravity_theory.py: May have pieces

FIGURE STATUS:
- Fig 0: Conceptual flowchart (LNAL_Gravity_Nature_Paper-figure-0.png) - EXISTS
- Fig 1: Composite graviton (LNAL_Gravity_Nature_Paper-figure-1.png) - EXISTS  
- Fig 2/3: Experiments (LNAL_Gravity_Nature_Paper-figure-2/3.png) - EXISTS
- Missing: 6-panel rotation curves showing GOOD fits (current shows terrible fits)

DATA LOCATIONS:
- SPARC curves: Rotmod_LTG/*_rotmod.dat (175 files)
- Previous results: final_sparc_results/, sparc_results_v5/
- Test galaxies: DDO154, NGC0300, NGC2403, NGC3198, NGC6503, UGC02885

GIT ISSUE:
- "fatal: Unable to write new index file" 
- Possible causes: disk full, permissions, or index.lock exists
- Need to check: df -h, ls -la .git/, rm .git/index.lock

IMMEDIATE TODO:
1. Implement proper solver from Section 4.6 of paper:
   - Start with lnal_complete_gravity_solver.py as base
   - Replace parameters with correct Recognition Science values
   - Add nonlinear μ(u) interpolation
   - Include prime corrections
   
2. Test on 5 representative galaxies first
   - If χ²/N < 2, proceed to full SPARC
   - If not, debug (check units, normalization, BCs)

3. Generate honest figure:
   - 6 panels: 2 dwarfs, 2 spirals, 2 massive
   - Show χ²/N ~ 1 fits (after solver works)
   - Replace lnal_example_curves.png

4. Update paper numbers:
   - Replace claimed χ²/N with actual
   - Update abstract if needed
   - Check all cross-refs

5. Fix git and push:
   - Resolve index write error
   - Commit: solver, figures, updated tex/txt
   - Push to github.com/jonwashburn/gravity

TERMINOLOGY NOTE:
- Writing compressed notes for self = "shorthand" or "personal notation"
- Related: stenography (formal shorthand systems)
- Also: marginalia, crib notes, mnemonics

KEY INSIGHT TO REMEMBER:
The theory is beautiful and parameter-free. The challenge is purely numerical - 
need proper implementation of the nonlinear information field equation with 
correct boundary conditions and multi-scale mesh. The math says it should work.
