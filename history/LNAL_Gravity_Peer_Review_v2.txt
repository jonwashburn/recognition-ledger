SUMMARY
The authors have impressively addressed the major concerns from the previous review. The revised manuscript presents a more realistic experimental outlook, clarifies key theoretical points, and is better structured. The work remains highly ambitious and compelling. This review focuses on improving clarity, contextualization, and impact.

STRENGTHS (of the revision)
1. **Experimental Realism**: The new feasibility analysis for the torsion-balance experiment is honest and the proposed differential-suppression protocol is well-conceived. The switch to a miniaturized test mass for atom interferometry is a crucial correction.
2. **Structural Improvements**: Segregating speculative claims into an "Outlook" section significantly improves the paper's focus and credibility.
3. **Theoretical Clarifications**: The corrections to the composite graviton state and the dark energy calculation are welcome and necessary.

MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FINAL POLISHING
1. **Add Essential Figures**: The paper's conceptual density is its greatest challenge. Professionally rendered figures are essential for reader comprehension. I strongly recommend adding:
   - **Fig. 1: Conceptual Diagram**: A flowchart showing the logical progression from "Axioms" -> "Information Debt" -> "Ledger Strain" -> "Einstein Equations".
   - **Fig. 2: Experimental Schematics**: (a) The differential torsion-balance setup showing the Au/PtIr spheres and modulation scheme. (b) The atom-chip interferometer with the miniaturized test mass.
   - **Fig. 3: Composite Graviton**: A simple diagram illustrating the `BRAID` operation on two photons to form a spin-2 graviton.

2. **Contextualize with Competing Theories**: The introduction mentions Verlinde and Jacobson, but a dedicated paragraph in the Discussion section is needed to compare and contrast LNAL with other emergent gravity theories. How does LNAL's information-processing approach differ from thermodynamic/entropic arguments? What unique predictions does it make that others do not?

3. **Refine Abstract and Conclusion**:
   - **Abstract**: The abstract is good but could be punchier. Focus on the three key results: (1) Derivation of GR from information axioms, (2) Testable prediction of running-G at nm-scales, (3) Resolution of cosmological puzzles (dark energy/matter).
   - **Conclusion**: The conclusion should briefly reiterate the revised, more modest experimental outlook. Acknowledge that while direct confirmation is a long-term goal, the proposed intermediate experiments can still strongly constrain the theory.

MINOR BUT IMPORTANT SUGGESTIONS
- **Equation Numbering**: The manuscript should adopt a single, sequential numbering scheme for equations (1, 2, 3...) rather than restarting in each section. This is standard practice and aids navigation.
- **Define `k`**: The wavevector `k` in the atom interferometry phase formula should be explicitly defined (e.g., as the effective momentum-transfer wavevector).
- **Expand LNAL Pseudocode**: The `compute_gravity` pseudocode is very helpful. Add 1-2 sentences explaining what `neighbors` refers to (e.g., adjacent voxels in the processing lattice).

CONCLUSION
This is a vastly improved manuscript. If the authors incorporate the recommended figures and add the comparative discussion, this paper will be a landmark contribution. The core ideas are profound; the remaining work is about making them as clear and accessible as possible to a broad physics audience. I recommend acceptance after these revisions.
