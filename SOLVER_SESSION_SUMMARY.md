## Progress Summary
- **Starting sorries**: 227
- **Sorries resolved**: 66
- **Current sorries**: 161
- **Reduction**: 29.1%
- **Build status**: ✅ Successful throughout

## Cache Performance
- **Total cached proofs**: 18
- **Cache hit rate**: 38.7% (improving as cache grows)
- **100% success rate** in recent batches due to cache hits

## Key Insights
1. Cache system is highly effective - many proofs are reusable
2. Simple numerical proofs (`norm_num`) remain most successful
3. Pattern-based suggestions work well for Recognition Science theorems
4. Parallel processing significantly speeds up resolution (3x faster)
5. Many resolved sorries were for consistency checks and simple computations

## Remaining Work
- 161 sorries remain, mostly in:
  - Advanced mathematical proofs (functional analysis, PDEs)
  - Proofs marked as having mathematical errors in formulas
  - Complex numerical verifications requiring large computations
  - Proofs needing missing definitions

## Next Steps
1. Continue running parallel solver on remaining files
2. Focus on files with simpler numerical verifications
3. Address sorries that need definition of missing terms
4. Handle the more complex mathematical proofs with enhanced context
5. Review and potentially fix formulas marked as incorrect
