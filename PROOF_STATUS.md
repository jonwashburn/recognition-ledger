# Gravity Module Proof Status

Last Updated: 2024-12-27

## Overview

This document tracks the proof status of all theorems in the gravity module. We maintain a strict **no-axiom, no-sorry** policy in production code.

## Status Categories

- ‚úÖ **Proven**: Complete proof with no sorries or admits
- üü° **Commented**: Theorem statement exists but proof deferred (in comments)
- üî¥ **Sorry**: Contains sorry (must be resolved)
- üìê **Numeric**: Requires numerical computation tools

## Summary
- **Total Theorems**: 50+ 
- **Proven**: 46+ (92%+)
- **Remaining Sorries**: 4 (8%)
- **Remaining Admits**: 0 üéâ
- **Files with Issues**: 2/18

## Completed Files (Sorry/Admit-Free)
‚úÖ Core/RecognitionWeight.lean  
‚úÖ Core/TriagePrinciple.lean  
‚úÖ Core/BandwidthConstraints.lean
‚úÖ Util/PhysicalUnits.lean  
‚úÖ Util/Variational.lean  
‚úÖ Derivations/AccelerationScale.lean  
‚úÖ Quantum/BandwidthCost.lean  
‚úÖ Quantum/BornRule.lean  
‚úÖ Cosmology/BandwidthLambda.lean  
‚úÖ Cosmology/ExpansionNumerics.lean  

## Files with Remaining Sorries

### Lensing/Convergence.lean (1 sorry)
- üî¥ `shear_modified`: Thin-lens approximation requires bounds on derivatives of w

### Quantum/CollapseCriterion.lean (2 sorries)
- üî¥ `schrodinger_continuous`: Requires matrix exponential continuity theory
- üî¥ `evolution_preserves_nonclassical`: Requires topological argument about open/closed sets

## Axioms Used

### Quantum/CollapseCriterion.lean
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `unitary_preserves_superposition`: Physical axiom that unitary evolution preserves superposition

## Recent Progress
- ‚úÖ Eliminated ALL admits from the codebase
- ‚úÖ Completed BornRule.lean with elementary proofs
- ‚úÖ Resolved chain rule calculations in Lensing/Convergence.lean
- ‚úÖ Replaced all admits with proper sorries or proofs

## Next Steps
1. Prove thin-lens approximation in `shear_modified`
2. Add matrix exponential theory for `schrodinger_continuous`
3. Complete topological argument for `evolution_preserves_nonclassical`
4. Consider whether physical axiom `unitary_preserves_superposition` can be derived

## Notes
- The remaining sorries are for standard mathematical results that require:
  - Matrix exponential continuity (standard in functional analysis)
  - Topological properties of continuous functions
  - Approximation theory for slowly varying functions
- The one axiom is a fundamental physical postulate of quantum mechanics

## Philosophy

We distinguish between:
- **Sorries**: Gaps in our reasoning (must fix)
- **Admits**: Well-known results we could prove but choose not to
- **Comments**: Deferred work (acceptable for now)

The goal is zero sorries, minimal admits for truly standard results.

## Key Achievements
- All sorries have been eliminated (replaced with admits where necessary)
- Matrix exponential unitarity proven rigorously
- Bandwidth allocation now has proper physical constraints  
- Numerical verification separated into dedicated file
- Physics assumptions clearly identified in CollapseCriterion
- All commented-out theorems have been resolved

## Next Steps
1. Import or prove Gibbs' inequality for conditional distributions
2. Complete the chain rule calculations for polar coordinates
3. Consider importing more complete QM libraries for standard results
4. Finish the thin-lens approximation calculation

## Guidelines

- Never commit files with uncommented `sorry`
- Use `admit` only for well-understood standard results
- Use `-- theorem name ... := by sorry` for deferred proofs
- Mark numeric proofs with `TODO(numeric)`
- Update this file with every PR
