- Cosmological predictions
- Gauge theory derivations
- Neutrino properties

- Renormalization group flow
- Mass generation mechanism
- Quantum measurement

### Philosophical (Ethics domain) - 49 sorries
- Consciousness formalization
- Virtue dynamics

- Requires different proof techniques

## Key Achievements
1. **Foundation Complete**: Zero-axiom base fully formalized
2. **Numerical Framework**: Golden ratio calculations verified
3. **Structure Ready**: All major components scaffolded
4. **Predictions Made**: Specific numerical values derived

## Priority Recommendations
1. **Physics First**: Complete the 8 physics sorries to validate core predictions
2. **Formal Next**: The 20 formal sorries establish mathematical rigor
3. **Gravity Theory**: The 40 gravity sorries represent novel physics
4. **Ethics Last**: The 49 ethics sorries are a separate philosophical project

## Build Instructions
```bash
lake build                    # Build all components
lake build foundation         # Verify zero-axiom foundation
lake exe verify electron_mass # Test specific predictions
```

## Git Merge Conflicts
Several files contain unresolved merge conflicts (<<<<<<< HEAD markers):
- `README.md`
- `NumericalVerification.lean`
These should be resolved before further development.

## Axiom Usage

The project uses 56 axioms outside the foundation, primarily for:
- **Numerical Tactics**: 22 axioms (11 each in formal/ and helpers/)
- **Meta-Principle**: 8 axioms in formal/MetaPrinciple.lean
- **Theorem Scaffolding**: 8 axioms for proof structure
- **Information Theory**: 4 axioms for entropy bounds
- **Various**: 14 axioms across other files

Note: The foundation itself uses NO axioms - everything is derived from the meta-principle definition.

## Technical Debt Notes

1. **Duplicate NumericalTactics.lean**: Same file with 11 axioms appears in both formal/ and helpers/
2. **File naming issue**: `formal/RecognitionScience/AxiomProofs 2.lean` has a space in the name
3. **Git conflicts**: README.md and NumericalVerification.lean have unresolved merge conflicts

## Inventory Files

- `SORRY_INVENTORY.md`: Complete list of files with sorries and counts
- `AXIOM_INVENTORY.md`: Complete list of files with axioms and counts

## Archived Status Documents
All previous status documents have been moved to `archived_status_docs/` to reduce confusion. This file (`PROOF_STATUS.md`) is now the single source of truth for project status.

## Key Architectural Improvement
- **Eliminated Redundancy**: The formal/AxiomProofs.lean was attempting to re-prove what foundation/ already proves with zero axioms/sorries
- **Single Source of Truth**: All axiom proofs now come from foundation/ directory
- **Clean Dependency Graph**: Fixed imports in RecognitionScience.lean and Phase1_Foundation.lean
