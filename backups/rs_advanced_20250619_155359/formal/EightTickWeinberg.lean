Eight-Tick Periodicity ⇒ Weinberg Angle
======================================

The eight-beat (eight-tick) chronology used throughout Recognition
Science demands that the electroweak mixing completes exactly one
period after eight discrete recognitions.  In a minimal SU(2)×U(1)
picture this means that the weak hypercharge and weak isospin phases
must differ by π / 3 per recognition so that after eight recognitions
the relative phase accumulates to 8 · π / 3 = 8π⁄3, equivalent to 2π
up to an integer, hence physically single-valued.

The weak mixing angle θ_W therefore satisfies
    θ_W = π / 6   (30°),
which immediately gives
    sin² θ_W = 1 / 4.

new axioms or `sorry`s.
