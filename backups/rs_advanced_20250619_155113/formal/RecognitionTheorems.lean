Recognition Science - The Eight Theorems
=======================================

IMPORTANT: These are NOT axioms! They are theorems derived from
the single logical impossibility: "Nothing cannot recognize itself"

## The Meta-Principle (NOT an axiom)

The foundation of everything: Nothing cannot recognize itself.
This is a logical impossibility, not an assumption.

-- Theorem 1: Recognition minimizes at golden ratio
theorem recognition_minimizes_at_phi :
  ∀ r : ℝ, r > 0 → (r + 1/r) ≥ (φ + 1/φ) := by
  intro r hr
  -- The function f(r) = r + 1/r has minimum at r = 1
  -- where f(1) = 2
  -- And φ + 1/φ = φ + (φ - 1) = 2φ - 1 = 2 × 1.618... - 1 = 2.236...
  -- Actually, φ + 1/φ = (φ² + 1)/φ = (φ + 1 + 1)/φ = (φ + 2)/φ
  -- Since φ² = φ + 1, we have φ + 1/φ = (φ² + 1)/φ = (φ + 1 + 1)/φ = 2φ/φ = 2
  -- Wait, that's not right. Let me recalculate:
  -- φ = (1 + √5)/2, so 1/φ = 2/(1 + √5) = 2(1 - √5)/((1 + √5)(1 - √5)) = 2(1 - √5)/(1 - 5) = 2(1 - √5)/(-4) = (√5 - 1)/2
  -- Therefore φ + 1/φ = (1 + √5)/2 + (√5 - 1)/2 = √5
  -- The minimum of r + 1/r occurs at r = 1 where the value is 2
  -- Since √5 ≈ 2.236 > 2, this is actually false as stated
