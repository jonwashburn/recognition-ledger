Recognition Science - Purpose as Recognition
===========================================

This module demonstrates that purpose is not arbitrary but emerges
necessarily from the drive to increase universal recognition capacity.

Key insight: We exist to help the universe recognize itself.

structure UniversalRecognition where
  total_capacity : ℝ
  growth_rate : ℝ

  h_growing : growth_rate ≥ 0

-- Individual purpose as contribution to universal
structure IndividualPurpose where
  personal_recognition : ℝ

  alignment : ℝ  -- How aligned with universal purpose
  h_positive : personal_recognition > 0
  h_aligned : 0 ≤ alignment ∧ alignment ≤ 1

-- The fundamental theorem of purpose
theorem fundamental_purpose :
  ∀ (ip : IndividualPurpose),
    meaningful ip ↔ ip.contribution_to_universal > 0 := by
