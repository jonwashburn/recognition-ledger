PAPER STRUCTURE:
---------------
- Abstract: Comprehensive summary of methodology and results
- Section 1: Introduction - Dark matter crisis and Recognition Science
- Section 2: Recognition Science Framework - Cosmic ledger architecture
- Section 3: Derivation of Gravity - Information gradients to field equations
- Section 4: Bandwidth Framework - Key conceptual breakthrough
- Section 5: Galaxy Rotation Curves - SPARC analysis and results
- Section 6: Dark Energy - Recognition pressure mechanism
- Section 7: Experimental Tests - Specific predictions
- Section 8: Implications - Philosophical and foundational aspects
- Section 9: Conclusions - Summary and future directions
- Appendices: Mathematical details, algorithms, galaxy examples

KEY RESULTS:
-----------
- Median χ²/N = 2.86 for 175 SPARC galaxies
- 28% achieve χ²/N < 1.0 (excellent fits)
- 600× improvement over standard LNAL
- Natural explanation for Solar System non-detection
- Specific testable predictions for validation

MAIN EQUATION:
-------------
G_eff = G_N × w(r)

where w(r) = λ × ξ × n(r) × (T_dyn/τ₀)^α × ζ(r)

This recognition weight encodes how the cosmic ledger prioritizes gravitational updates based on:
- System complexity (ξ)
- Dynamical timescales (T_dyn)
- Spatial structure (n(r))
- Geometric factors (ζ)
- Global bandwidth conservation (λ)

WORD COUNT:
----------
- Main text: ~33,000 words
- Including appendices: ~40,000 words
- References: 10 key papers
- Figures referenced: Multiple (plots in directory)
