# Recognition Science: Gravity Module

[![Lean Verification](https://github.com/jonwashburn/gravity-rs-lean/actions/workflows/lean.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jonwashburn/gravity-rs-lean/actions/workflows/lean.yml)

This repository contains the Lean 4 formalization of gravity as emergent from bandwidth-limited information processing, part of the Recognition Science framework.

## Overview

Recognition Science derives gravity from first principles by recognizing that maintaining gravitational fields requires information processing under bandwidth constraints. This leads to:

- **Dark matter** emerges as refresh lag in gravitationally bound systems
- **Dark energy** represents bandwidth conservation at cosmic scales  
- **MOND phenomenology** follows naturally from optimization under constraints
- **Quantum collapse** occurs when maintaining superposition exceeds bandwidth

## Proof Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Recognition Weight | ✅ Proven | Derived from foundation axioms |
| Quantum Evolution | ✅ Proven | Unitary properties proven in foundation |
| Thin Lens Approximation | ✅ Proven | Mathematical approximation theorem |
| Bandwidth Conservation | 📐 Axiom | Physical principle |
| Bandwidth Sum | 📐 Axiom | Resource allocation constraint |

**Total**: 0 sorries, 0 admits, 2 physical axioms

## Key Results

### Recognition Weight Function
The fundamental equation governing modified gravity:
```
w(r) = λ × ξ × n(r) × (T_dyn/τ₀)^α × ζ(r)
```

Where:
- `λ`: Global normalization (bandwidth conservation)
- `ξ`: Complexity factor (turbulence, gas content)
- `n(r)`: Spatial refresh profile
- `T_dyn/τ₀`: Dynamical time ratio
- `ζ(r)`: Geometric corrections

### Emergent MOND Scale
The characteristic acceleration scale emerges naturally:
```
a₀ ≈ 10^{-10} m/s² 
```
when refresh lag becomes comparable to dynamical time.

### Dark Energy Density
From bandwidth conservation at cosmic scales:
```
Λ = (2.26 meV)⁴
```
