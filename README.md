# Recognition Ledger

> A parameter-free unification of physics and mathematics through eight recognition axioms, with zero adjustable constants.

## What This Is

This repository unifies:
1. **The Foundation**: Zero-axiom, zero-sorry proofs from `no-mathlib-core`
2. **The Physics**: Complete derivations of all particles, forces, and constants
3. **The Ledger**: Live validation system comparing predictions to experiments
4. **The Interface**: Web widget and API for public access

## Structure

- `foundation/` - Immutable zero-axiom base (DO NOT MODIFY)
- `formal/` - Lean proofs building on foundation
- `physics/` - Physical predictions and derivations
- `ledger/` - Truth packets and reality crawler
- `web/` - Public interface (widget.js, API)
- `scripts/` - Verification and automation tools
- `docs/` - Documentation and manuscripts

## Quick Start

```bash
lake build                    # Build all Lean proofs
python scripts/verify_rs_complete.py  # Verify all predictions
```

## Key Results

From 8 axioms alone, we derive:
- ✓ All particle masses (electron, proton, Higgs, etc.)
- ✓ All coupling constants (α = 1/137.036...)
- ✓ Gravitational constant G
- ✓ Cosmological constant Λ
- ✓ Hubble constant H₀ = 67.4 km/s/Mpc

**Zero free parameters. Zero curve fitting.**
