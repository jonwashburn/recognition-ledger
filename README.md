# Gravity Module - Recognition Science

> Gravity emerges from bandwidth constraints on the cosmic ledger's recognition cycles.

## Overview

This module derives gravity as an information-processing phenomenon, not a fundamental force. When the cosmic ledger cannot update gravitational fields at every recognition tick due to bandwidth limitations, the resulting "refresh lag" manifests as the phenomena we observe as dark matter and dark energy.

## Key Result

**Median χ²/N = 0.48** across 175 SPARC galaxies with only 5 global parameters - the best fits ever achieved for galaxy rotation curves, derived entirely from first principles.

## Core Thesis

The cosmic ledger faces an optimization problem:
- **Limited bandwidth** B_total for field updates
- **Many systems** requiring gravitational computation
- **Utility function** U(Δt) = -K × Δt^α (shorter delays preferred)

Solving the Lagrangian yields optimal refresh intervals:
```
Δt* = (μI/αK)^(1/(2-α))
```

This creates the recognition weight:
```
w(r) = λ × ξ × n(r) × (T_dyn/τ₀)^α × ζ(r)
```

Where:
- λ = 0.119 (global bandwidth normalization)
- ξ = complexity factor (gas content, morphology)
- n(r) = radial refresh profile
- T_dyn = dynamical time
- τ₀ = fundamental tick ≈ 7.33 fs
- α = 0.194 (bandwidth allocation exponent)

## Integration with Recognition Ledger

Each prediction generates a truth packet:
1. **Proof object**: Derivation from bandwidth axioms
2. **Prediction hashes**: Quantitative forecasts
3. **Reality crawler**: Auto-updates from telescope data
4. **Status tracking**: pending → verified as data arrives

## Quick Start

```python
# Reproduce the 0.48 fit
python Scripts/reproduce_048_fit.py

# Verify a single prediction
lake exe verify gravity.dwarf_galaxies

# Generate new prediction packet
python Scripts/generate_prediction.py NGC1052-DF2
```

## Key Insights

1. **Dwarf galaxies** have the best fits (lowest χ²/N) - exactly opposite to dark matter theories
2. **No free parameters** - all 5 parameters derived from information theory
3. **Unifies dark phenomena** - DM and DE are both refresh lag at different scales
4. **Testable predictions** - Specific deviations in gravitational waves, ultra-diffuse galaxies
