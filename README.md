## Key Results

From 8 foundational theorems alone, we derive:

## Recent Improvements

- Integrated cleaner architecture from Recognition-Science-Journal
- Added `foundation/Core/Derivations/` with mathematical derivations of all constants
- Removed redundant axiom files (formal/axioms.lean, formal/Core/AxiomProofs.lean)
- Fixed imports and namespaces throughout
- All constants now emerge from the meta-principle with zero free parameters

# Recognition Science: Gravity Module

[![Lean Verification](https://github.com/jonwashburn/gravity-rs-lean/actions/workflows/lean.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jonwashburn/gravity-rs-lean/actions/workflows/lean.yml)

This repository contains the Lean 4 formalization of gravity as emergent from bandwidth-limited information processing, part of the Recognition Science framework.

## Overview

Recognition Science derives gravity from first principles by recognizing that maintaining gravitational fields requires information processing under bandwidth constraints. This leads to:

- **Dark matter** emerges as refresh lag in gravitationally bound systems
- **Dark energy** represents bandwidth conservation at cosmic scales  
- **MOND phenomenology** follows naturally from optimization under constraints
- **Quantum collapse** occurs when maintaining superposition exceeds bandwidth

## Proof Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Recognition Weight | ✅ Proven | Derived from foundation axioms |
| Quantum Evolution | ✅ Proven | Unitary properties proven in foundation |
| Thin Lens Approximation | ✅ Proven | Mathematical approximation theorem |
| Bandwidth Conservation | 📐 Axiom | Physical principle |
| Bandwidth Sum | 📐 Axiom | Resource allocation constraint |

**Total**: 0 sorries, 0 admits, 2 physical axioms

## Key Results

### Recognition Weight Function
The fundamental equation governing modified gravity:
```
w(r) = λ × ξ × n(r) × (T_dyn/τ₀)^α × ζ(r)
```

Where:
- `λ`: Global normalization (bandwidth conservation)
- `ξ`: Complexity factor (turbulence, gas content)
- `n(r)`: Spatial refresh profile
- `T_dyn/τ₀`: Dynamical time ratio
- `ζ(r)`: Geometric corrections

### Emergent MOND Scale
The characteristic acceleration scale emerges naturally:
```
a₀ ≈ 10^{-10} m/s² 
```
when refresh lag becomes comparable to dynamical time.

### Dark Energy Density
From bandwidth conservation at cosmic scales:
```
Λ = (2.26 meV)⁴
```

## Integration with Recognition Science

This gravity module is part of the larger Recognition Science framework. The dependency flow is:

```
Meta-Principle: "Nothing cannot recognize itself"
    ↓
Eight Axioms (proven from meta-principle)
    ↓
Foundation Layer (constants, basic theorems)
    ↓
Gravity Module (this repository)
```

## Papers

The formalization corresponds to these papers:

1. **"Gravity Derived From First Principles"** - Conceptual foundations
2. **"Galaxy Rotation Without Dark Matter"** - Empirical validation on SPARC data
3. **"Quantum-Gravity Unification"** - Full framework including quantum collapse

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure:
- No `sorry` or `admit` in proofs
- All axioms must be physical principles, not mathematical properties
- Follow the established import hierarchy
- Add tests for new theorems
