YANG-MILLS LEAN PROOF AI COMPLETION SYSTEM
==========================================

This system uses 4 parallel AI agents to complete the remaining 26 sorries
in the Yang-Mills Lean proof.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

1. SECURE YOUR API KEY
   Never commit your API key to git. Use one of these methods:

   Method A (Recommended - One-time setup):
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-actual-key-here'
   ```
   Add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to make it permanent.

   Method B (Per-session):
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-actual-key-here' ./run_proof_completion.sh
   ```

2. RUN THE COMPLETION SYSTEM
   ```bash
   ./run_proof_completion.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Create a Python virtual environment
   - Install required dependencies
   - Backup your current Lean files
   - Run 4 specialized AI agents in parallel
   - Apply generated proofs to the source files
   - Verify the build

WHAT THE AGENTS DO
------------------

1. AlgebraicAgent
   - Handles: Type class instances, module structures
   - Files: TransferMatrix.lean, RSImport/*.lean
   - Sorries: ~3

2. SpectralAgent
   - Handles: Matrix eigenvalues, spectral theory
   - Files: TransferMatrix.lean
   - Sorries: ~11

3. GaugeAgent
   - Handles: SU(3) structure, gauge theory
   - Files: BalanceOperator.lean, GaugeResidue.lean
   - Sorries: ~3

4. QFTAgent
   - Handles: Path integrals, correlation functions
   - Files: OSReconstruction.lean
   - Sorries: ~9

MONITORING PROGRESS
-------------------

Watch the console output. You'll see:
- Each agent finding sorries
- Proofs being generated and applied
- Success/failure for each proof
- Final build verification

In another terminal, monitor remaining sorries:
```bash
watch -n 10 'grep -r "sorry" YangMillsProof/*.lean | wc -l'
```

ESTIMATED TIME
--------------
1-4 hours depending on:
- API response times
- Proof complexity
- Build verification time

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

1. If some proofs fail:
   - Check the console output for specific errors
   - The script creates backups in backups/
   - Manually fix failed proofs using the generated attempts as starting points

2. If build fails after completion:
   - Run `lake build` to see specific errors
   - Check for missing imports
   - Verify mathlib version compatibility

3. API rate limits:
   - The script uses conservative delays
   - If you hit limits, wait and restart

MANUAL VERIFICATION
-------------------

After completion:
```bash
lake build
lake exe lean4checker YangMillsProof
```

BACKUP RESTORATION
------------------

If needed, restore from backup:
```bash
cp -r backups/YangMillsProof_[timestamp]/* YangMillsProof/
```

NEXT STEPS
----------

Once all sorries are resolved:
1. Run comprehensive tests
2. Generate proof documentation
3. Submit for peer review
4. Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

For questions or issues, check the generated proofs in each file
and the console output for specific error messages.
