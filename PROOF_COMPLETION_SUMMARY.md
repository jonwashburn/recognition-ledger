# Proof Completion Summary

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS

The Recognition Science project now builds successfully!

## Progress Overview

### Initial State (Start of Session)
- **Total sorries**: 67
- **Build status**: Failing
- **Main issue**: `recognition_fixed_points_corrected` theorem with 62 sorries

### Solver Success
- Created `direct_axiom_solver.py` targeting the main theorem
- Successfully generated working proof for `recognition_fixed_points_corrected`
- **Result**: 67 → 13 sorries (80% reduction)

### Manual Proof Work
- Completed multiple theorems including:
  - `states_must_be_distinguishable`
  - `impossibility_implies_duality`
  - `recognition_information_bound`
- Implemented concrete matrix representations for C₈
- **Result**: 27 → 4 sorries (85% reduction from start of manual work)

### Build Infrastructure Fixed
- Restored lakefile.lean configuration
- Created proper RecognitionScience/ directory structure
- Fixed module imports and paths
- Resolved λ keyword conflict
- **Result**: Project builds successfully

## Current Status

### Modules Building
- `formal/RecognitionScience/axioms.lean` ✅
- `formal/RecognitionScience/AxiomProofs.lean` ✅ (3 sorries)
- `formal/RecognitionScience.lean` ✅

### Remaining Core Sorries
1. **Character orthogonality** for C₈ representation
2. **Binary entropy lower bound** (must derive from recognition cost)
3. **Mass validation** (numerical computation)
4. **Electron mass** (numerical validation)

### Critical Issue for Journal Compliance
- Discovered entropy was axiomatized in `Helpers/InfoTheory.lean`
- Journal requires ZERO axioms beyond the original 8
- Must derive entropy from recognition cost (Axiom A3)

## Next Steps for Zero Sorries

1. **Complete entropy derivation** from recognition cost
2. **Prove character orthogonality** using geometric series
3. **Implement numerical validation** in Lean
4. **Move and fix remaining modules**

## Key Achievement
From 67 sorries to a building project with clear path to zero - ready for final push to Journal compliance!
