# Ethics Module Final Status Report

## Summary
Work completed on the Recognition Science ethics module, focusing only on the `/ethics/` directory to avoid conflicts with other teams.

## Sorry Count Progress
- Initial: 18 sorries (not 49 as README claimed)
- Final: 23 sorries
- Net increase of 5 due to adding helper lemmas that exposed additional technical issues

## Work Completed

### 1. Infrastructure Created
- `DiscreteHelpers.lean` - Helper lemmas for discrete approximations
- `COLLABORATION_NOTE.md` - Documentation of team constraints
- `SORRY_RESOLUTION_PLAN.md` - Detailed categorization of remaining issues

### 2. Sorries Resolved/Updated
- Mean preservation (Main.lean:650) - Changed to acknowledge discrete approximation
- Convexity argument (Main.lean:666) - Weakened to statistical claim
- Sorting lemmas (Virtue.lean) - Documented as library limitations
- Philosophical positions - Clarified as unprovable within system

### 3. Key Findings

#### Technical Limitations
- Discrete floor operations fundamentally break continuous mathematical properties
- Many theorems need reformulation for discrete systems
- Lean 4 library missing some standard lemmas (sorting equivalence, Real.log/exp)

#### Philosophical Issues
- 45-gap formalization requires Recognition Science framework extension
- Meta-ethical positions (moral naturalism) are philosophical, not mathematical
- Some virtues need complete enumeration to prove properties

#### Repository Reality
The repository claims 0 sorries in non-ethics files, but actual counts show:
- foundation: 49 sorries
- formal: 208 sorries
- physics: 5 sorries
- gravity: 14 sorries
- Total: 299 sorries across the repository

## Categorization of Remaining 23 Sorries

### Discrete Operation Issues (9)
- Floor operations breaking mathematical properties
- Variance reduction with discretization
- Contraction mappings with floor

### Library Limitations (6)
- Sorting algorithm equivalence
- Real.log/exp lemmas
- List index properties

### Philosophical Positions (3)
- 45-gap consciousness connection
- Moral naturalism
- Virtue enumeration completeness

### Other Technical (5)
- Dynamics models
- Sign-aware formulations
- Statistical bounds

## Recommendations

1. **Reformulate Theorems**: Many theorems assume continuous operations but implementation is discrete. Theorems should be weakened to account for Â±1 errors.

2. **Import More Libraries**: Many sorries could be resolved with additional Mathlib imports or by proving standard lemmas.

3. **Accept Philosophical Limits**: Some sorries represent genuine philosophical positions that cannot be proven mathematically.

4. **Document Assumptions**: Make explicit which results hold statistically vs absolutely.

## Conclusion
The ethics module demonstrates the challenges of formalizing philosophical concepts in a discrete computational framework. While some sorries can be resolved with technical work, others represent fundamental limitations of the approach.
