# Ethics Module Sorry Elimination Status

## Current Status: 45 sorries remaining (down from 48)

### Progress Summary
- Started with 48 sorries across ethics module
- Fixed 3 sorries so far:
  1. `ExtendedLedger.toSimple` - Changed to `toSimpleBalanced` with balance requirement
  2. `LedgerAdapter.toSimple` - Changed to `toSimpleBalanced` 
  3. `GoldenVirtues.love_transfer_optimization` - Fixed simplified model case

### Categories of Remaining Work

1. **Mathematical Properties (15 sorries)**
   - Floor/ceiling functions with negative values
   - List ordering properties
   - Real number/logarithm calculations

2. **Model Specifications (12 sorries)**
   - How virtues affect states
   - Virtue interaction models
   - Energy/cost relationships

3. **Invariant Maintenance (10 sorries)**
   - Non-negative constraints
   - Balance/debt consistency
   - Energy conservation

4. **Proof Completions (8 sorries)**
   - Virtue optimality at phases

   - Enhancement factors

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Add Missing Invariants**: Many sorries need additional invariants (e.g., non-negative totals)
2. **Simplify Complex Proofs**: Some proofs about floor functions might be avoided by restructuring
3. **Complete Model Specifications**: Define precise models for virtue effects
4. **Import More Mathlib**: Some mathematical sorries might be solved with better library support

### Priority Order
1. Fix simple invariant sorries (add constraints to structures)
2. Complete model specifications
3. Tackle mathematical property proofs
4. Finish complex derivation proofs
