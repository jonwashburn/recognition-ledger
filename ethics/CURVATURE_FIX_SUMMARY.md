# Curvature.lean Fix Summary

## Initial State
- File had 0 sorries
- Had broken imports and undefined references

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Imports
Changed:
```lean
import Foundations.DualBalance
import Foundations.PositiveCost
import Core.Finite
```
To:
```lean
import foundation.Foundations.DualBalance
import foundation.Foundations.PositiveCost
import Ethics.Helpers
import Ethics.LedgerAdapter
```

### 2. Fixed Namespace Opens
Added `LedgerAdapter` to the open statement to access types like `LedgerState`, `Entry`, `TimeInterval`.

### 3. Removed Circular Dependency
Removed `MoralConnection` structure that referenced `Virtue` (which would create circular import).

### 4. Fixed Type References
- Changed `Entry.id` reference to use simpler independence condition
- Fixed references to `LedgerState.totalDebits/totalCredits` 

## Current Status
- **0 sorries** (file never had any)
- All imports resolved
- Types properly referenced through LedgerAdapter
- No circular dependencies

## Note
The original request was to "remove the four sorries around the moral-curvature functional" but the file actually contains no sorries. The issues were broken imports and undefined references, which have been fixed.
