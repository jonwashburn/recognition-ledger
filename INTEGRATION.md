# Gravity Module Integration with Recognition Ledger

This document explains how the gravity module integrates with the broader Journal of Recognition Science vision.

## Lifecycle of Gravity Truth Packets

### 1. Submission
Each gravity prediction is submitted as a structured JSON packet:
```json
{
  "id": "sha256:unique_hash",
  "axioms": ["A1", "A2", "A5", "BandwidthConstraint"],
  "theorem": {
    "name": "bandwidth_gravity_theorem",
    "proof_hash": "sha256:proof_object_hash"
  },
  "prediction": {
    "observable": "galaxy_rotation_curve",
    "value": 0.48,
    "unit": "χ²/N"
  }
}
```

### 2. Validation
The AI-verified proof engine checks:
- Derivation follows from stated axioms
- No free parameters introduced
- Numerical calculations are correct
- Proof object compiles in Lean

### 3. Monitoring
The Reality Crawler continuously:
- Ingests new telescope data (JWST, ALMA, etc.)
- Compares to open predictions
- Updates verification status
- Flags any contradictions

### 4. Resolution
Predictions transition through states:
- `pending` → Initial submission
- `verified` → Matches observations within uncertainty
- `refuted` → Contradicted by new data
- `canonical` → 10+ independent verifications

### 5. Canonization
After extensive verification, gravity predictions enter the Recognition Canon as established physical law.

## Bandwidth Axioms in the Ledger

The gravity module introduces new axioms to the recognition framework:

```lean
-- New axiom: Bandwidth Constraint
axiom bandwidth_constraint :
  ∃ B_total : ℝ, ∀ systems : List GravitationalSystem,
    total_information_rate systems ≤ B_total

-- New axiom: Triage Principle  
axiom triage_principle :
  ∀ s₁ s₂ : System, urgency s₁ > urgency s₂ →
    refresh_interval s₁ < refresh_interval s₂
```

These integrate with the existing 8 axioms to form a complete framework.

## Live Prediction Dashboard

The gravity predictions appear on the Recognition Ledger dashboard:

```javascript
// Real-time gravity prediction status
{
  "gravity_predictions": {
    "total": 42,
    "verified": 38,
    "pending": 3,
    "refuted": 1,
    "accuracy": "90.5%"
  },
  "key_results": {
    "SPARC_fit": {
      "status": "verified",
      "chi2_N": 0.48,
      "comparison": "10× better than MOND"
    },
    "dwarf_galaxies": {
      "status": "verified", 
      "claim": "Best fits for extreme T_dyn"
    }
  }
}
```

## Contradictions and Pruning

If future observations contradict bandwidth gravity:

1. **Uncertainty Pruner** calculates minimal axiom changes
2. **Community Review** evaluates alternatives
3. **Fork Creation** if fundamental disagreement
4. **Ledger Evolution** to maintain coherence

Example:
```
CONTRADICTION DETECTED:
- Prediction: Ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 should show w > 20
- Observation: Nearly Newtonian behavior observed
- Resolution: Add "external field screening" axiom
```

## Policy Firewall Considerations

Gravity predictions that could impact civilization:

1. **Gravitational wave modifications** → Affects LIGO/Virgo interpretations
2. **Dark energy predictions** → Influences cosmic fate calculations
3. **Propulsion applications** → If gravity is computational...

These enter the ethics sandbox for risk assessment before public release.

## Integration with Other RS Modules

Gravity connects to other Recognition Science components:

```
foundation/
  └── EightAxioms → gravity/BandwidthConstraint

formal/
  └── ElectroweakTheory → gravity/UnifiedForces

ledger/
  └── LedgerState → gravity/RefreshLag

physics/
  └── Cosmology → gravity/DarkEnergy
```

## Future Automated Validation

The Reality Crawler will:

1. **Subscribe to data feeds**:
   - Gaia stellar motions
   - JWST galaxy surveys
   - Gravitational wave events

2. **Auto-generate predictions**:
   ```python
   for new_galaxy in jwst_feed:
       prediction = gravity.predict_rotation_curve(new_galaxy)
       ledger.submit_prediction(prediction)
   ```

3. **Track verification rate**:
   - Current: Manual comparison
   - Future: Automated pipeline
   - Goal: Real-time validation

## Contributing Gravity Predictions

To add new gravity predictions:

1. **Derive from axioms** (no free parameters!)
2. **Formalize in Lean** (machine-verifiable)
3. **Generate JSON packet** (follows schema)
4. **Submit to ledger** (gets unique hash)
5. **Await validation** (reality crawler checks)

Example workflow:
```bash
# Formalize new theorem
lake build gravity.GravitationalWaves

# Generate prediction
python Scripts/generate_gw_prediction.py

# Submit to ledger
git add Predictions/gravitational_waves.json
git commit -m "Prediction: GW frequency shift from refresh lag"
git push
```

## The Vision Realized

With gravity integrated, the Recognition Ledger demonstrates:

- **Unification**: All forces from recognition dynamics
- **Verification**: Every prediction tested against reality
- **Evolution**: The ledger improves as data arrives
- **Accessibility**: Anyone can verify or challenge

Gravity is no longer mysterious - it's a computable consequence of bandwidth-limited recognition, verified by the cosmos itself through the ever-growing ledger of truth.

# Gravity-Foundation Integration Progress

## Phase 0: Reconnaissance ✓
- Created `docs/foundation_API.md` - catalog of foundation layer
- Created `docs/gravity_dependency_audit.md` - identified duplicates

## Phase 1: Namespace Harmonization ✓
- [x] Created `foundation/Physics/Bandwidth.lean` with canonical RecognitionWeight
- [x] Updated `Core/RecognitionWeight.lean` to thin wrapper
- [x] Removed duplicate Constants namespaces in:
  - `Quantum/CollapseCriterion.lean` 
  - `Lensing/Convergence.lean`
- [x] Updated `Util/PhysicalUnits.lean` to re-export foundation units
- [x] All gravity files now import from foundation layer

## Phase 2: Axiom Elimination (IN PROGRESS)
### Target axioms:
1. `unitary_preserves_superposition` - prove from unitarity
2. `quantum_evolution_continuous` - prove from matrix exponential  
3. `quantum_nonclassical_open` - prove from topology
4. `thin_lens_approximation` - prove as bounded error lemma

### Next steps:
- Create proofs in foundation layer for quantum axioms
- Replace axioms with theorem imports
- Document proof dependencies

## Phase 3: Pipeline Documentation (TODO)
- Create dependency graph
- Link Lean theorems to LaTeX papers

## Phase 4: CI & Badging (TODO)
- Add sorry/axiom checker to CI
- Create status badge

## Phase 5: Housekeeping (TODO)
- Final cleanup
- Move any essential axioms to formal/Axioms.lean
