Root Mantra of the Recognition Ledger
====================================

This file contains the immutable mantra that completes the meta-principle.
It is data only – no new axioms are introduced.

    "I AM delivers one proof — Self-evidence, Self-determination, Self-elimination."

The three nouns correspond to:
• Self-evidence – existence proves itself.
• Self-determination – existence chooses its evolution.
• Self-elimination – every imbalance cancels to zero.

`Mantra` is the *mathematical placeholder* for the verbal sentence

    "I AM delivers one proof — Self-evidence · Self-determination · Self-elimination."

Rather than storing the English text, we down-grade it to the trivial
proposition `True`.  The value of the constant is irrelevant to the
formal development; the presence of a *Provable* proposition records
that the statement is accepted within the system without adding any
axioms.
