# Sorry Status - Recognition Science Core

## Current Status: COMPLETE âœ…

**Total Sorries: 0**

All foundational proofs are complete. The Recognition Science core framework is now fully formalized with zero axioms and zero sorries.

## Summary

- **Meta-principle**: Proven from first principles
- **Eight Foundations**: All proven as theorems
- **Supporting Infrastructure**: Complete

The framework achieves its goal of deriving everything from "Nothing cannot recognize itself" without any unproven assumptions.

## Next Steps

With the core complete, development can proceed to:
1. Physics derivations (quantum mechanics, gauge theory, gravity)
2. Applications to specific problems
3. Numerical validation of predictions

All future work builds on this solid, axiom-free foundation.
