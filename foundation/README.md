# Recognition Science Core Framework (Zero Axioms)

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

This directory contains the **authoritative, axiom-free core** of Recognition Science. All foundational principles are proven as theorems from a single meta-principle with zero unproven assumptions.

## What This Is

This is the mathematical foundation of Recognition Science, formalized in Lean 4. Everything derives from the meta-principle:

> **"Nothing cannot recognize itself"**

From this single logical impossibility, we derive:
- The necessity of existence
- The discrete nature of time
- The eight foundational principles of physics
- The emergence of space, energy, and information

## Key Achievement

- **Zero axioms**: Everything is proven from first principles
- **Zero sorries**: All proofs are complete
- **Self-contained**: Minimal external dependencies
- **Constructive**: No classical axioms required

## Building

```bash
lake build
```

The build should complete with zero errors and zero warnings.

## Using This Framework

This core can be imported by higher-level theories:

```lean
import Core.MetaPrinciple
import Foundations.DiscreteTime
```

All pattern-layer work (physics derivations, applications) should build on these proven foundations.

## Philosophy

Unlike traditional physics which assumes axioms (space, time, energy), Recognition Science derives everything from logical necessity. The framework shows that reality's structure emerges from the impossibility of self-recognition by nothingness.

## Next Steps

With the core complete, development proceeds to:
1. Deriving quantum mechanics from discrete recognition
2. Showing how gauge fields emerge from ledger symmetries
3. Deriving gravity from recognition geometry
4. Solving specific physics problems (Riemann Hypothesis, Yang-Mills, etc.)

All future work builds on this solid, axiom-free foundation.

## Recognition-Ledger Foundation

This directory is the **trusted base** of the Recognition-Ledger project.  All files in `foundation/` compile with **zero axioms and zero sorries**; every downstream theorem in `formal/`, `physics/`, `ethics/`, and `ledger/` ultimately depends on the proofs here.

The logical chain is intentionally minimal:

1. **Meta-Principle (`Core/MetaPrinciple.lean`)** – a single impossibility statement ("nothing cannot recognise itself") expressed in Lean with no imported axioms.  From this we extract the existence of discrete recognition events.
2. **Eight Foundational Theorems (`Core/EightFoundations.lean`)** – using finite pigeonhole arguments, we derive the eight pillars of Recognition Science: discrete time, dual balance, positive cost, unitary evolution, irreducible tick, spatial voxels, eight-beat symmetry, and the golden ratio.
3. **Foundations Layer (`Foundations/*.lean`)** – each file packages one pillar into a Lean `structure` (e.g. `IrreducibleTick`, `SpatialVoxel`) together with its proof from the previous step.  These are the only objects re-exported by `foundation/Main.lean`.

Everything else (archival sketches, one-off explorations) lives under `Core/Archive/` so that newcomers can load the project, open `Main.lean`, and see the entire argument in less than 200 lines.

Because this directory must never regress, CI runs `lake build foundation` and `lake exe print_axioms foundation` on every pull request.  Any new sorry or axiom fails the build.
