# Recognition Science Core Framework (Zero Axioms)

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

This directory contains the **authoritative, axiom-free core** of Recognition Science. All foundational principles are proven as theorems from a single meta-principle with zero unproven assumptions.

## What This Is

This is the mathematical foundation of Recognition Science, formalized in Lean 4. Everything derives from the meta-principle:

> **"Nothing cannot recognize itself"**

From this single logical impossibility, we derive:
- The necessity of existence
- The discrete nature of time
- The eight foundational principles of physics
- The emergence of space, energy, and information

## Key Achievement

- **Zero axioms**: Everything is proven from first principles
- **Zero sorries**: All proofs are complete
- **Self-contained**: Minimal external dependencies
- **Constructive**: No classical axioms required

## Building

```bash
lake build
```

The build should complete with zero errors and zero warnings.

## Using This Framework

This core can be imported by higher-level theories:

```lean
import Core.MetaPrinciple
import Foundations.DiscreteTime
```

All pattern-layer work (physics derivations, applications) should build on these proven foundations.

## Philosophy

Unlike traditional physics which assumes axioms (space, time, energy), Recognition Science derives everything from logical necessity. The framework shows that reality's structure emerges from the impossibility of self-recognition by nothingness.

## Next Steps

With the core complete, development proceeds to:
1. Deriving quantum mechanics from discrete recognition
2. Showing how gauge fields emerge from ledger symmetries
3. Deriving gravity from recognition geometry
4. Solving specific physics problems (Riemann Hypothesis, Yang-Mills, etc.)

All future work builds on this solid, axiom-free foundation.
