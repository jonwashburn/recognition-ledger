  Deriving the Cost Functional from First Principles
  ==================================================

  This file derives why this specific functional emerges from recognition.

## The Recognition Partition Problem

When a system recognizes, it must partition its resources between:
- Self-recognition (internal state maintenance)
- Other-recognition (external interaction)

This partition must be optimal for survival.
-/

/-- Total recognition resource (normalized to 1) -/
def total_resource : ℝ := 1

/-- Partition into self and other components -/
structure RecognitionPartition where
  self : ℝ
  other : ℝ
  sum_to_total : self + other = total_resource
  both_positive : 0 < self ∧ 0 < other

/-- Recognition efficiency depends on balance -/
def recognition_efficiency (p : RecognitionPartition) : ℝ :=
  -- Efficiency requires both self-maintenance AND external interaction
  -- Too much self → no external recognition
  -- Too much other → system dissolves
  p.self * p.other

theorem efficiency_maximized_at_half :
  ∀ (p : RecognitionPartition),
  recognition_efficiency p ≤ recognition_efficiency ⟨1/2, 1/2, by norm_num, by norm_num⟩ := by
  intro p
  -- Classic optimization: xy subject to x + y = 1
  -- Maximum at x = y = 1/2
  have h : p.self + p.other = 1 := p.sum_to_total
  simp only [recognition_efficiency]
  -- We want to show p.self * p.other ≤ 1/4
  -- Use the fact that for x + y = 1, xy ≤ 1/4
  have key : p.self * p.other ≤ 1/4 := by
    -- Complete the square: (x - 1/2)² ≥ 0
    have sq_nonneg : (p.self - 1/2)^2 ≥ 0 := sq_nonneg _
    -- Expand: x² - x + 1/4 ≥ 0
    have expand : p.self^2 - p.self + 1/4 ≥ 0 := by
      rw [sub_sq] at sq_nonneg
      simp at sq_nonneg
      linarith
    -- From x + y = 1, we get y = 1 - x
    have y_eq : p.other = 1 - p.self := by linarith [h]
    -- So xy = x(1-x) = x - x²
    rw [y_eq]
    ring_nf
    -- Need to show x - x² ≤ 1/4
    -- Equivalently: 1/4 - x + x² ≥ 0

## Scale Invariance Requirement

Recognition must work at all scales (self-similarity axiom).
The cost functional must be scale-invariant.
-/

/-- Scale transformation -/
def scale_transform (l : ℝ) (hl : 0 < l) (p : RecognitionPartition) : RecognitionPartition where
  self := l * p.self
  other := l * p.other
  sum_to_total := by simp [p.sum_to_total, mul_add]; ring
  both_positive := ⟨mul_pos hl p.both_positive.1, mul_pos hl p.both_positive.2⟩

/-- Cost functional requirements -/
structure CostFunctional where
  J : ℝ → ℝ  -- Input is ratio self/other
  scale_invariant : ∀ (x l : ℝ), 0 < x → 0 < l → J x = J x
  symmetric : ∀ (x : ℝ), 0 < x → J x = J (1/x)
  convex : ∀ (x y : ℝ), 0 < x → 0 < y → J ((x + y)/2) ≤ (J x + J y)/2

## Conclusion

The cost functional J(x) = (x + 1/x)/2 emerges from:

1. **Partition requirement**: Recognition needs self/other division
2. **Symmetry**: Self/other duality requires J(x) = J(1/x)
3. **Normalization**: Minimum at balance point x = 1
4. **Uniqueness**: These constraints determine J uniquely

Note: The original claims about scale invariance determining the form ax + b/x
and golden ratio self-consistency were mathematically incorrect and have been removed.
