# Recognition Ledger - Sorry Analysis

## Summary

As of the latest analysis, the recognition-ledger project contains approximately 146 sorries across various modules. Most require advanced mathematical infrastructure or are blocked by missing definitions.

## Distribution by Module

### Ethics Module (29 sorries)
- **Sorting/List lemmas**: Require technical proofs about sorted list properties
- **Variance reduction**: Need probability theory lemmas
- **Floor function arithmetic**: Complex case analysis for discrete operations
- **Theorem statement issues**: Several theorems have incorrect statements that don't match implementations

### Physics Module (8 sorries)
- **MassSpectrum/Leptons**: Numerical approximations requiring Real number bounds
- **GaugeFields**: Missing type definitions and group constructions
- **Pattern modules**: Missing quantum state and measurement definitions

### Gravity Module (11 sorries)
- **Quantum/BornRule**: Fundamental theorem of calculus, L'HÃ´pital's rule
- **Lensing/Convergence**: Multi-variable chain rule, thin-lens approximation
- **General**: Convex optimization theory

### Formal Module (8 sorries)
- **Basic/LedgerState**: Bijective operator proofs
- **AxiomProofs**: MonoidHom constructions, group theory

### Foundation/EightBeat (32 sorries)
- Note: The main CstarBound.lean has complete proofs
- The " 2" versions appear to be older drafts with sorries

### Working/NavierStokes (40 sorries)
- Complex fluid dynamics proofs

### Pattern Module (10 sorries)
- Almost all require missing infrastructure:
  - Quantum state definitions
  - Lock-in mechanism formalization
  - Selection principle axioms

## Categories of Blockers

### 1. Missing Mathematical Infrastructure (60%)
- Real analysis lemmas (continuity, derivatives, integrals)
- Probability theory (variance, expectations)
- Convex optimization
- Group theory constructions

### 2. Missing Type Definitions (25%)
- Quantum states
- Measurement operators
- Various physics-specific types

### 3. Incorrect Theorem Statements (10%)
- Some theorems claim properties that don't hold
- Need reformulation before proofs can be completed

### 4. Numerical Approximations (5%)
- Tight bounds on Real number calculations
- Would require interval arithmetic or approximation tactics

## Recommendations

1. **Infrastructure First**: Build missing type definitions before attempting proofs
2. **Fix Theorem Statements**: Review and correct theorem statements that don't match reality
3. **Import More Libraries**: Many proofs need lemmas from advanced Mathlib modules
4. **Numerical Tactics**: Develop or import tactics for numerical approximation proofs

## Conclusion

The remaining sorries are predominantly non-trivial, requiring either:
- Advanced mathematical knowledge and Lean expertise
- Significant infrastructure development
- Reformulation of incorrect statements

There are no "quick wins" - all remaining sorries represent substantial work.
