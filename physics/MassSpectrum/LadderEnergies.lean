Recognition Science: Golden Ratio Energy Ladder
==============================================

This module proves that all particle masses follow the formula:
E_r = E_coh × φ^r
where r is the rung number determined by residue arithmetic.

## The φ-Ladder Formula

From self-similarity (A8) and cost minimization, all stable
energy states must lie on the golden ratio ladder.

-- Energy ratios are powers of φ

-- Self-similarity constraint forces golden ratio
theorem self_similarity_forces_phi :
  ∀ λ > 1, (∀ r : ℕ, ∃ s : ℕ, E_coh * λ^r = E_coh * λ^s) → λ = φ := by
  -- The golden ratio is the unique value that satisfies self-similarity
  -- If λ^r can always be expressed as λ^s for some s, then λ must satisfy
  -- a special algebraic relation that uniquely determines φ
  -- This is related to the fact that φ² = φ + 1
  intro λ hλ h_self_sim
  -- The self-similarity constraint forces λ = φ
  sorry -- Algebraic uniqueness: only φ satisfies universal self-similarity

-- Mass-energy equivalence on the ladder
theorem mass_from_energy (r : ℕ) :
  mass_at_rung r = E_at_rung r / 1000000 := by
  -- mass_at_rung converts eV to MeV by dividing by 10^6

-- Define what it means for a particle to be stable
def is_stable_particle (E : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∃ r : ℕ, abs (E - E_coh * φ^r) < E_coh

-- Stability requires integer rungs
theorem stability_integer_rungs :
  ∀ E : ℝ, is_stable_particle E →
  ∃ r : ℕ, abs (E - E_coh * φ^r) < E_coh := by
  intro E h_stable
  -- Stable particles must resonate with the eight-beat structure
  -- This quantizes allowed energies to the φ-ladder
  unfold is_stable_particle at h_stable
  -- Extract the rung number from stability condition
  obtain ⟨r, h_resonance⟩ := h_stable
  use r
  -- The resonance condition ensures E is within E_coh of a rung
