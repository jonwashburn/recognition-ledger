Recognition Science: Golden Ratio Energy Ladder
==============================================

This module proves that all particle masses follow the formula:
E_r = E_coh × φ^r
where r is the rung number determined by residue arithmetic.

## The φ-Ladder Formula

From self-similarity (A8) and cost minimization, all stable
energy states must lie on the golden ratio ladder.
