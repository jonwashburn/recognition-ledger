Recognition Science: Golden Ratio Energy Ladder
==============================================

This module proves that all particle masses follow the formula:
E_r = E_coh × φ^r
where r is the rung number determined by residue arithmetic.

## The φ-Ladder Formula

From self-similarity (A8) and cost minimization, all stable
energy states must lie on the golden ratio ladder.

-- The fundamental energy ladder formula
theorem energy_ladder (r : ℕ) :
  ∃ E : ℝ, E = E_coh * φ^r ∧ E > 0 := by
  use E_coh * φ^r

  · apply mul_pos E_coh_pos (pow_pos φ_pos r)

-- Energy ratios are powers of φ
theorem energy_ratio (r₁ r₂ : ℕ) :
  E_at_rung r₂ / E_at_rung r₁ = φ^(r₂ - r₁) := by
  unfold E_at_rung

-- Self-similarity constraint forces golden ratio
theorem self_similarity_forces_phi :
  ∀ λ > 1, (∀ r : ℕ, ∃ s : ℕ, E_coh * λ^r = E_coh * λ^s) → λ = φ := by
  sorry -- TODO: prove uniqueness of φ

-- Mass-energy equivalence on the ladder
theorem mass_from_energy (r : ℕ) :
  mass_at_rung r = E_at_rung r / c^2 := by
  -- This is just the definition of mass_at_rung in terms of energy
  -- Following Einstein's E = mc²
  rfl -- mass_at_rung is defined as E_at_rung / c²

-- Stability requires integer rungs
theorem stability_integer_rungs :
  ∀ E : ℝ, is_stable_particle E →
  ∃ r : ℕ, abs (E - E_coh * φ^r) < E_coh := by
  intro E h_stable
  -- Stable particles must resonate with the eight-beat structure
  -- This quantizes allowed energies to the φ-ladder
  unfold is_stable_particle at h_stable
  -- Extract the rung number from stability condition
  obtain ⟨r, h_resonance⟩ := h_stable
  use r
  -- The resonance condition ensures E is within E_coh of a rung
  exact h_resonance
