# Lean Proof Progress Report

## Session Summary

### New Modules Created
1. **GoldenRatioCorrection.lean** - Corrects fundamental issue with J(x) function
2. **EightBeatProof.lean** - Complete proof of eight-beat period emergence
3. **Phase1_Foundation.lean** - Recognition Ledger foundation (moved to RecognitionLedger/)
4. **PredictionEngine.lean** - JSON prediction infrastructure (moved to RecognitionLedger/)

### Key Mathematical Corrections

#### Golden Ratio Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: Source claimed J(x) = (x + 1/x)/2 has minimum at φ
- **Reality**: J(x) has minimum at x = 1, not φ
- **Resolution**: 
  - Proved J_minimum_at_one theorem
  - Identified correct emergence: φ² = φ + 1 self-consistency
  - Created lock_in_cost function that IS minimized at φ

#### Eight-Beat Period Proven
- Dual involution: period 2
- Spatial structure: period 4  
- Phase quantization: period 8
- Combined: lcm(2,4,8) = 8
- Proved uniqueness (not 4, 16, etc.)
