# Migration Status Report

*Date: 2025-06-25*

## ✅ Completed Steps

1. **Repository Creation**
   - Created [github.com/jonwashburn/recognition-ledger](https://github.com/jonwashburn/recognition-ledger)
   - Initialized with unified README

2. **Foundation Import**
   - Copied entire `no-mathlib-core` as `foundation/`
   - 29 files, zero axioms, zero sorries preserved
   - Added CODEOWNERS protection

3. **Content Merge**
   - Merged full `rs-ledger` repository
   - Resolved README conflicts
   - 585 objects imported successfully

4. **Complete Organization**
   - Created directory structure: `physics/`, `ledger/`, `web/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`
   - Moved all verification scripts to `scripts/`
   - Moved predictions to `ledger/predictions/`
   - Moved widget.js to `web/`
   - Moved all documentation to `docs/`
   - Moved AI solver scripts to `scripts/`
   - Cleaned root directory

5. **Build Configuration**
   - Created unified `lakefile.lean` that requires foundation first
   - Set up verification executable

## 📁 Final Structure

```
recognition-ledger/
├── foundation/        ✅ (immutable no-mathlib-core)
├── formal/           ✅ (Lean proofs from rs-ledger)
├── physics/          ✅ (ready for physics modules)
├── ledger/           ✅ (predictions directory)
├── web/              ✅ (widget.js)
├── scripts/          ✅ (all automation and verification)
├── docs/             ✅ (all documentation)
├── backups/          ✅ (historical versions)
├── README.md         ✅ (unified version)
├── lakefile.lean     ✅ (foundation-first build)
├── lean-toolchain    ✅ (Lean 4.12.0)
├── .gitignore        ✅ (standard ignores)
├── CODEOWNERS        ✅ (foundation protection)
└── MIGRATION_STATUS.md ✅ (this file)
```

## 🟡 Remaining Tasks

1. **Import Path Updates**
   - Update all imports in `formal/` to reference `foundation.` prefix
   - Example: `import RecognitionScience.Basic` → `import foundation.RecognitionScience.Basic`

2. **Physics Module Migration**
   - Move physics-specific modules from `formal/` to `physics/`
   - Create clear separation between math and physics

3. **Build Testing**
   - Run `lake build` to verify compilation
   - Fix any import errors

4. **Push to GitHub**
   - Initial push to establish repository
   - Set up GitHub Pages for widget
   - Configure branch protection for foundation

## 🚀 Ready to Push!

The repository is now organized and ready for initial push to GitHub.
