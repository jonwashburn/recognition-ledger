# Sorry Resolution Status - Formal Directory

## Completed (Partially)
1. **RecognitionScience/AxiomProofs.lean** (1 of 2 completed)
   - ✅ `cost_minimization_golden_ratio`: Proved using monotonicity of f(x) = x² - x - 1
   - ⚠️ `recognition_fixed_points`: Started but needs proper involution construction

## In Progress
2. **Cosmology/DarkEnergy.lean** (0 of 2 completed)
   - ⚠️ `dark_energy_observation_consistent`: Needs high-precision arithmetic
   - ⚠️ `spectral_index_consistent`: Formula may need correction

## Not Actually Sorries
3. **EightTickWeinberg.lean** - No sorries found (only in comment)
4. **Variational.lean** - Uses axiom, not sorry
5. **RG/Yukawa.lean** - Uses axioms, not sorries

## Remaining Work

### ParticleMassesRevised.lean (4 sorries)
- `electron_mass_correct`: Needs Fibonacci number computation
- `lock_in_condition` in `particle_mass_mechanism`
- `universal_mass_formula`: Needs to unfold energy_at_rung recursion
- Plus one more not explicitly shown

### ParticlePhysics/Neutrinos.lean (2 sorries)
- `cosmological_bound`: Requires numerical computation of sum
- `sterile_mixing_small`: Has incorrect inequality (needs fixing)

## Technical Challenges Encountered

1. **Involution Construction**: Building an involution with exactly 2 fixed points is surprisingly complex in Lean
2. **Numerical Computation**: Dark energy and particle masses require high-precision arithmetic
3. **Formula Verification**: Some formulas (like spectral index) may have errors in the original specification

## Actual Sorry Count Correction
The original count of 13 sorries in formal/ appears to be incorrect. The actual count is:
- AxiomProofs.lean: 2 sorries (1 remaining)
- DarkEnergy.lean: 2 sorries
- ParticleMassesRevised.lean: 4 sorries
- Neutrinos.lean: 2 sorries
- **Total: 10 sorries** (not 13)

Several files listed as having sorries actually use axioms instead.
