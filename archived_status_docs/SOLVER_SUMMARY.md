# Recognition Science Solver Summary

## Current Status
- **Total sorries remaining**: 220
- **Build status**: Successful
- **API requirement**: Yes (for automated proof generation)

## Solver Options

### 1. Advanced Recognition Solver (`advanced_recognition_solver.py`)
- **Features**: 
  - Full Recognition Science context
  - Individual proof validation before applying
  - Automatic backup creation
  - Detailed error reporting
- **Requirements**: 
  - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet access
- **Usage**: `python3 Solver/advanced_recognition_solver.py --proofs-per-file 5`

### 2. Simple Filler (`simple_recognition_filler.py`)
- **Features**: 
  - No API needed
  - Targets only trivial proofs (norm_num, simp, etc.)
  - Limited scope
- **Usage**: `python3 Solver/simple_recognition_filler.py`

## Top Priority Files (by sorry count)
1. `formal/MetaPrinciple.lean` - 18 sorries
2. `formal/AxiomProofs.lean` - 15 sorries  
3. `formal/Core/GoldenRatio.lean` - 15 sorries
4. `formal/Core/EightBeat.lean` - 15 sorries
5. `formal/Numerics/ErrorBounds.lean` - 13 sorries

## Easiest Targets
- ErrorBounds consistency proofs
- EWCorrections field_simp proof
- Basic numerical verifications

## Recommendations

1. **Set API Key**: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key-here'`
2. **Start with easy files**: ErrorBounds, Philosophy files
3. **Use small batches**: 3-5 proofs per file to monitor progress
4. **Always backup first**: The solvers create automatic backups

## Manual Alternative
Continue resolving sorries manually as we've been doing. The solver can help with:
- Repetitive numerical proofs
- Standard tactics (norm_num, linarith, field_simp)
- Consistency proofs in ErrorBounds

The Recognition Science context is already embedded in the advanced solver.
