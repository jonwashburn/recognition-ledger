## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Formula Corrections Needed
- Dark energy formula gives ~10^-100 instead of 10^-52 m^-2
- Hubble constant off by factor of ~27
- Universe age calculation gives 357 Myr instead of 13.8 Gyr
- Some neutrino mass formulas give wrong scales

### 2. Conceptual Challenges
- J(φ) = √5/2 ≠ φ (need to clarify fixed point definition)
- φ^115 ≈ 10^24, not 10^36 as claimed for hierarchy
- Several "density argument" proofs needed for φ-ladder coverage

### 3. Remaining Major Sorries
- CompletePhysics.lean: ~20 conceptual sorries about physics emergence
- CompletedAxiomProofs.lean: Many axiom derivation sorries
- Various numerical verification sorries requiring precise φ^n calculations

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Fix the cosmological formulas to match observations
2. **Priority 2**: Complete φ power calculations for all particle masses
3. **Priority 3**: Resolve conceptual issues with J function and fixed points
4. **Priority 4**: Work on density arguments for φ-ladder theorems
5. **Priority 5**: Complete the axiom derivations from meta-principle

## Technical Notes
- Many proofs now use `norm_num` for numerical verification
- Triangle inequality patterns established for mass calculations
- Axiom instances can be accessed directly (e.g., `DiscreteRecognition.L_injective`)
- AM-GM inequality useful for J function properties

This represents significant progress toward a complete formalization of Recognition Science!
