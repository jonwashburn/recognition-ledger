## Selection Rules

Not all mathematically possible patterns can manifest physically.
Selection follows strict rules based on ledger balance and eight-beat constraints.

-- Pattern compatibility with current reality state
def is_compatible (p : Pattern) (r : RealityState) : Prop :=
  ledger_remains_balanced (lock_in p r) ∧
  eight_beat_preserved (lock_in p r)

-- Selection probability based on cost
noncomputable def selection_weight (p : Pattern) : ℝ :=
  exp (- recognition_cost p / (k_B * T))

-- Allowed transitions between patterns
def transition_allowed (p₁ p₂ : Pattern) : Prop :=
  conservation_satisfied p₁ p₂ ∧
  causality_preserved p₁ p₂ ∧
  eight_beat_compatible p₁ p₂

-- The selection functional minimizes total cost
noncomputable def selection_functional (path : List Pattern) : ℝ :=
  path.enum.foldl (fun acc (i, p) => acc + recognition_cost p) 0 +
  path.zip (path.tail).foldl (fun acc (p₁, p₂) => acc + transition_cost p₁ p₂) 0

-- Define realized_path as the minimum cost path
noncomputable def realized_path (initial final : Pattern) : List Pattern :=
  argmin selection_functional (all_paths initial final)

-- Nature selects minimum cost paths
theorem least_action_selection :
  ∀ (initial final : Pattern),
  realized_path initial final =
  argmin selection_functional (all_paths initial final) := by
  intro initial final
  -- By definition of realized_path
  rfl

-- Quantum superposition before selection with external normalization
def superposition_state_normalized (patterns : List Pattern) (amps : List ℂ)
  (h_norm : (amps.map (fun a => Complex.abs a ^ 2)).sum = 1) : QuantumState :=
  { patterns := patterns

  superposition_state_normalized patterns normalized_amps (by
    -- Proof that normalized amplitudes sum to 1
    sorry  -- This is a standard normalization proof
  )

-- Define probability of selection

  match ψ.patterns.indexOf? p with
  | some i => Complex.abs (ψ.amplitudes.get! i) ^ 2

theorem selection_implies_conservation :
  ∀ (conserved_quantity : Pattern → ℝ),
  (∀ p₁ p₂, transition_allowed p₁ p₂ →
   conserved_quantity p₁ = conserved_quantity p₂) := by
  intro conserved_quantity p₁ p₂ h_allowed
  -- Transition allowed means conservation is satisfied
  unfold transition_allowed at h_allowed
  obtain ⟨h_cons, h_caus, h_eight⟩ := h_allowed
  -- By definition of conservation_satisfied
  exact conservation_satisfied_implies_equal conserved_quantity p₁ p₂ h_cons

-- Forbidden patterns (violate core axioms)
def is_forbidden (p : Pattern) : Prop :=
  violates_dual_balance p ∨
  creates_net_debt p ∨
  breaks_eight_beat p

theorem forbidden_never_manifest :
  ∀ (p : Pattern), is_forbidden p →
  selection_weight p = 0 := by
  intro p h_forbidden
  unfold selection_weight
  -- Forbidden patterns have infinite cost
  have h_infinite_cost : recognition_cost p = ∞ := by
