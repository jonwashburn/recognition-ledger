Recognition Science: Pattern Selection Principle
==============================================

This module formalizes which patterns from the infinite library
can actually manifest in physical reality.

## Selection Rules

Not all mathematically possible patterns can manifest physically.
Selection follows strict rules based on ledger balance and eight-beat constraints.

-- Pattern compatibility with current reality state
def is_compatible (p : Pattern) (r : RealityState) : Prop :=
  ledger_remains_balanced (lock_in p r) ∧
  eight_beat_preserved (lock_in p r)

-- Selection probability based on cost
noncomputable def selection_weight (p : Pattern) : ℝ :=
  exp (- recognition_cost p / (k_B * T))

-- Allowed transitions between patterns
def transition_allowed (p₁ p₂ : Pattern) : Prop :=
  conservation_satisfied p₁ p₂ ∧
  causality_preserved p₁ p₂ ∧
  eight_beat_compatible p₁ p₂

-- The selection functional minimizes total cost
noncomputable def selection_functional (path : List Pattern) : ℝ :=
  ∑ i, recognition_cost path[i] +
  ∑ i, transition_cost path[i] path[i+1]

-- Nature selects minimum cost paths
theorem least_action_selection :
  ∀ (initial final : Pattern),
  realized_path initial final =
  argmin (selection_functional) (all_paths initial final) := by
  sorry -- TODO: prove least action

-- Quantum superposition before selection
def superposition_state (patterns : List Pattern) (amps : List ℂ) : QuantumState :=
  sorry -- TODO: define quantum state

-- Born rule emerges from selection weights
theorem born_rule_from_selection :
  ∀ (ψ : QuantumState) (p : Pattern),
  probability_of_selection ψ p =
  |amplitude ψ p|² := by
  sorry -- TODO: derive Born rule

-- Conservation laws from selection constraints
theorem selection_implies_conservation :
  ∀ (conserved_quantity : Pattern → ℝ),
  (∀ p₁ p₂, transition_allowed p₁ p₂ →
   conserved_quantity p₁ = conserved_quantity p₂) := by
  sorry -- TODO: Noether's theorem analog

-- Forbidden patterns (violate core axioms)
def is_forbidden (p : Pattern) : Prop :=
  violates_dual_balance p ∨
  creates_net_debt p ∨
  breaks_eight_beat p

theorem forbidden_never_manifest :
  ∀ (p : Pattern), is_forbidden p →
  selection_weight p = 0 := by
  intro p h_forbidden
  unfold selection_weight
  -- Forbidden patterns have infinite cost
  have h_infinite_cost : recognition_cost p = ∞ := by
    unfold is_forbidden at h_forbidden
    cases h_forbidden with
    | inl h_dual =>
      -- Violating dual balance means infinite cost
      exact cost_of_dual_violation h_dual
    | inr h_or =>
      cases h_or with
      | inl h_debt =>
        -- Creating net debt means infinite cost
        exact cost_of_net_debt h_debt
      | inr h_eight =>
        -- Breaking eight-beat means infinite cost
        exact cost_of_eight_beat_violation h_eight
  -- exp(-∞) = 0
  rw [h_infinite_cost]
  simp [exp_neg_inf]

-- Anthropic selection (observers require specific patterns)
theorem observer_constrains_selection :
  has_conscious_observer reality →
  ∃ (constraints : List Pattern),
  all_selected_patterns ⊆ observer_compatible_patterns := by
  sorry -- TODO: anthropic principle

-- Why these particular physical laws
