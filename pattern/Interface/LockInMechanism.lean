Recognition Science: Pattern Lock-In Mechanism
=============================================

This module formalizes how patterns crystallize from the timeless
Pattern Layer into physical Reality Layer when maintenance cost
exceeds 1 bit of information.

## Lock-In: Pattern → Reality

When the cost of maintaining a pattern in superposition exceeds
1 bit, the system "locks" it into classical reality, releasing
E_lock energy in the process.

  p.info_content * log (1 + t / τ₀)

  -- The pattern's information splits into:
  -- 1. Classical information in the resulting reality state
  -- 2. Thermodynamic information in the released energy

  -- The reality state contains most of the pattern information

    -- Lock-in occurs at 1 bit threshold, so 1 bit converts to energy
