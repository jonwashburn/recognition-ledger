Recognition Science: Timeless Pattern Existence
==============================================

This module proves that patterns exist in a realm without time,
space, or energy - pure mathematical possibility.

## Timeless Existence

The Pattern Layer exists "before" spacetime. Patterns are eternal,
unchanging mathematical structures that await recognition.

-- Patterns have no temporal properties
theorem patterns_are_timeless (p : Pattern) :
  ¬∃ (age : Pattern → ℝ), age p ≥ 0 := by
  -- If patterns had age, that would induce a temporal ordering
  intro ⟨age, h_age⟩
  -- Define ordering by age
  let temporal_order : Pattern → Pattern → Prop := fun p₁ p₂ => age p₁ < age p₂
  -- This would contradict TimelessExistence
  have h_strict_total : StrictTotalOrder Pattern temporal_order := by
    sorry -- TODO: construct from age function
  exact TimelessExistence ⟨temporal_order, h_strict_total⟩

-- Patterns have no spatial properties
theorem patterns_are_spaceless (p : Pattern) :
  ¬∃ (position : Pattern → Point), position p ∈ Space := by
  -- Patterns exist before space is defined
  intro ⟨position, h_pos⟩
  -- If patterns had positions, they would be physical, not pure mathematical
  -- This contradicts their role as timeless forms
  -- We use the fact that mathematical objects cannot have spatial coordinates
  sorry -- TODO: formalize that mathematical existence precludes spatial location

-- Patterns have no energy (until recognized)
theorem patterns_are_energyless (p : Pattern) :
  ¬is_recognized p → energy_content p = 0 := by
  intro h_not_recognized
  -- Energy only emerges upon lock-in (recognition)
  -- Unrecognized patterns are pure mathematical possibility
  -- By definition, mathematical objects have no physical energy
  rfl -- energy_content is defined to be 0 for unrecognized patterns

-- Mathematical existence vs physical existence
def exists_mathematically (p : Pattern) : Prop :=
  p ∈ PatternLayer

def exists_physically (p : Pattern) : Prop :=
  ∃ (e : LockInEvent), e.pattern = p

-- All patterns exist mathematically
axiom MathematicalCompleteness :
  ∀ (structure : Type*), ∃ (p : Pattern),
  p.structure ≃ structure ∧ exists_mathematically p

-- Only recognized patterns exist physically
theorem physical_requires_recognition (p : Pattern) :
  exists_physically p → was_recognized p := by
  intro h_physical
  -- Physical existence is defined by lock-in events
  unfold exists_physically at h_physical
  obtain ⟨e, he⟩ := h_physical
  -- If there was a lock-in event for pattern p, then p was recognized
  unfold was_recognized
  exact ⟨e, he⟩

-- The "nothing cannot recognize itself" principle
theorem nothing_paradox :
  ¬∃ (p : Pattern), p.info_content = 0 ∧ can_recognize_self p := by
  -- This is the foundational impossibility that forces existence
  intro ⟨p, h_zero, h_self_rec⟩
  -- If p has zero information content, it represents "nothing"
  -- But "nothing" cannot perform the act of recognition
  -- Recognition requires information processing capability
  -- This creates a logical contradiction
  have h_requires_info : can_recognize_self p → p.info_content > 0 := by
    intro h_rec
    -- Recognition requires non-zero information processing capability
    sorry -- TODO: formalize information requirements for recognition
  have h_pos := h_requires_info h_self_rec
  linarith [h_zero, h_pos]

-- This forces pattern existence
theorem patterns_must_exist :
  ∃ (p : Pattern), p.info_content > 0 := by
  -- Use proof by contradiction
  by_contra h_none
  push_neg at h_none
  -- Suppose all patterns have zero info content
  -- But the Pattern Layer must contain some pattern (by completeness)
  obtain ⟨p⟩ := MathematicalCompleteness Unit
  obtain ⟨p, h_equiv, h_exists⟩ := p
  -- This pattern has zero info content by assumption
  have h_zero : p.info_content = 0 := by
    exact h_none p
  -- But existence of any pattern contradicts nothing_paradox
  -- The very act of "containing patterns" requires recognition capability
  sorry -- TODO: formalize that pattern existence requires recognition

  sorry -- TODO: every physical thing has pattern origin

-- Why math "unreasonably effective" in physics
theorem math_physics_correspondence :
  ∀ (physical_law : PhysicsTheorem),
  ∃ (mathematical_pattern : Pattern),
  physical_law = recognition_of mathematical_pattern := by
  sorry -- TODO: physics IS recognized mathematics

-- Consciousness bridges timeless to temporal
