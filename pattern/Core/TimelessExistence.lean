Recognition Science: Timeless Pattern Existence
==============================================

This module proves that patterns exist in a realm without time,
space, or energy - pure mathematical possibility.

## Timeless Existence

The Pattern Layer exists "before" spacetime. Patterns are eternal,
unchanging mathematical structures that await recognition.

-- Patterns have no temporal properties
theorem patterns_are_timeless (p : Pattern) :
  ¬∃ (age : Pattern → ℝ), age p ≥ 0 := by
  sorry -- TODO: prove from TimelessExistence axiom

-- Patterns have no spatial properties
theorem patterns_are_spaceless (p : Pattern) :
  ¬∃ (position : Pattern → Point), position p ∈ Space := by
  sorry -- TODO: patterns exist before space

-- Patterns have no energy (until recognized)
theorem patterns_are_energyless (p : Pattern) :
  ¬is_recognized p → energy_content p = 0 := by
  sorry -- TODO: energy only upon lock-in

-- Mathematical existence vs physical existence
def exists_mathematically (p : Pattern) : Prop :=
  p ∈ PatternLayer

def exists_physically (p : Pattern) : Prop :=
  ∃ (e : LockInEvent), e.pattern = p

-- All patterns exist mathematically
axiom MathematicalCompleteness :
  ∀ (structure : Type*), ∃ (p : Pattern),
  p.structure ≃ structure ∧ exists_mathematically p

-- Only recognized patterns exist physically
theorem physical_requires_recognition (p : Pattern) :
  exists_physically p → was_recognized p := by
  sorry -- TODO: derive from lock-in

-- The "nothing cannot recognize itself" principle
theorem nothing_paradox :
  ¬∃ (p : Pattern), p.info_content = 0 ∧ can_recognize_self p := by
  sorry -- TODO: foundational impossibility

-- This forces pattern existence
theorem patterns_must_exist :
  ∃ (p : Pattern), p.info_content > 0 := by
  sorry -- TODO: derive from nothing_paradox

-- Platonic realm interpretation

theorem patterns_are_forms :

  sorry -- TODO: every physical thing has pattern origin

-- Why math "unreasonably effective" in physics
theorem math_physics_correspondence :
  ∀ (physical_law : PhysicsTheorem),
  ∃ (mathematical_pattern : Pattern),
