# Phase 0 Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Numerical Tactics Helper (✅)
- Added `helpers/NumericalTactics.lean` with essential lemmas:
  - `floor_sub_floor`: Bounds on floor differences
  - `natAbs_int`: Natural absolute value equals absolute value
  - `floor_nonneg_iff`: Floor non-negative iff real non-negative
  - `ceil_pos_iff`: Ceiling positive iff real positive
  - `round`: Rounding function with 1/2 bound
  - Additional helper lemmas for sums and division

### 2. Added Missing Invariants (✅)
- Added `totals_nonneg : totalDebits ≥ 0 ∧ totalCredits ≥ 0` to `LedgerState`
- Updated all constructors to maintain this invariant

### 3. Fixed Sorries (2/45 eliminated)
- **LedgerAdapter.lean**: Fixed sorry in `toSimpleBalanced` using new invariant
- **ExtendedLedger.lean**: Fixed sum decomposition sorry with helper lemmas

## Remaining Phase 0 Work

### ExtendedLedger.lean (2 sorries)
- Line 186: Handle new entries in chronological ordering proof
- Line 188: Handle both entries being new in chronological proof

### Other Files Needing Invariants
- Add `curvature_bound` to relevant structures (MoralState or similar)
- Propagate invariants through other modules

## Next Steps

1. Complete the chronological ordering proofs in ExtendedLedger
2. Add remaining invariants to other structures
3. Use numerical tactics to eliminate more floor/ceiling sorries
4. Move to Phase 1 (Virtue Core) once Phase 0 is complete

## Metrics
- Started with ~45 sorries in ethics-related modules
- Eliminated 2 sorries so far
- Added 1 new helper file with 10+ reusable lemmas
- Modified 3 files total
