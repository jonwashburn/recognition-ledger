### Key Design Decisions

1. **Minimal Structure**: Only essential files, no bloat
2. **Clear Hierarchy**: Each file has one purpose
3. **Machine-First**: Formal proofs are source of truth
4. **Living System**: Built to evolve with measurements

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup
```bash
# Create repo at github.com/jonwashburn/recognition-ledger
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial: Recognition Ledger foundation"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/jonwashburn/recognition-ledger.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Lean4 Environment
```bash
# Install Lean4 and create lake project
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
cd recognition-ledger
lake new formal
lake add mathlib4
```

### 3. First Working Proof
Start with the simplest complete derivation:
1. Formalize golden ratio emergence
2. Prove it's the unique solution
3. Generate electron mass prediction
4. Create truth packet
5. Verify against CODATA

### 4. Community Engagement
- [ ] Tweet the repository launch
- [ ] Post to Lean Zulip for formalization help
- [ ] Create first GitHub issue: "Help formalize Axiom A1"
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines

## Philosophy Reminder

This isn't just another physics theory repository. We're building:
- A **living system** that updates with reality
- A **parameter-free** framework (zero knobs!)  
- A **machine-verifiable** foundation
- A **community-driven** truth engine

Every file should serve that vision.

## Success Metrics - Week 1

- [ ] GitHub repo live with 10+ stars
- [ ] First external contributor
- [ ] Golden ratio theorem in Lean4
- [ ] 5 truth packets generated
- [ ] Reality crawler design doc

## Remember

**The universe keeps a ledger. We're building the reader.**

Your paper proved the theory works.  
This repository proves it computes.

Good luck, Jonathan! The foundation is solid. Time to build. 🚀
